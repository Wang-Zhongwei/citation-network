    "title": "Construction of the Literature Graph in Semantic Scholar",
    "abstract": "We describe a deployed scalable system for organizing published scientific literature into a heterogeneous graph to facilitate algorithmic manipulation and discovery. The resulting literature graph consists of more than 280M nodes, representing papers, authors, entities and various interactions between them (e.g., authorships, citations, entity mentions). We reduce literature graph construction into familiar NLP tasks (e.g., entity extraction and linking), point out research challenges due to differences from standard formulations of these tasks, and report empirical results for each task. The methods described in this paper are used to enable semantic features in www.semanticscholar.org.",

    "abstract": "Scientific literature understanding tasks have gained significant attention due to their potential to accelerate scientific discovery. Pre-trained language models (LMs) have shown effectiveness in these tasks, especially when tuned via contrastive learning. However, jointly utilizing pre-training data across multiple heterogeneous tasks (e.g., extreme classification, citation prediction, and literature search) remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose a multi-task contrastive learning framework, SciMult, with a focus on facilitating common knowledge sharing across different scientific literature understanding tasks while preventing task-specific skills from interfering with each other. To be specific, we explore two techniques -- task-aware specialization and instruction tuning. The former adopts a Mixture-of-Experts Transformer architecture with task-aware sub-layers; the latter prepends task-specific instructions to the input text so as to produce task-aware outputs. Extensive experiments on a comprehensive collection of benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of our task-aware specialization strategy in various tasks, where we outperform state-of-the-art scientific LMs.",

    "abstract": "With the recent advances in natural language processing (NLP), a vast number of applications have emerged across various use cases. Among the plethora of NLP applications, many academic researchers are motivated to do work that has a positive social impact, in line with the recent initiatives of NLP for Social Good (NLP4SG). However, it is not always obvious to researchers how their research efforts are tackling today's big social problems. Thus, in this paper, we introduce NLP4SGPAPERS, a scientific dataset with three associated tasks that can help identify NLP4SG papers and characterize the NLP4SG landscape by: (1) identifying the papers that address a social problem, (2) mapping them to the corresponding UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and (3) identifying the task they are solving and the methods they are using. Using state-of-the-art NLP models, we address each of these tasks and use them on the entire ACL Anthology, resulting in a visualization workspace that gives researchers a comprehensive overview of the field of NLP4SG. Our website is available at https://nlp4sg.vercel.app . We released our data at https://huggingface.co/datasets/feradauto/NLP4SGPapers and code at https://github.com/feradauto/nlp4sg .",

    "abstract": "There has been a rapid growth in biomedical literature, yet capturing the heterogeneity of the bibliographic information of these articles remains relatively understudied. Although graph mining research via heterogeneous graph neural networks has taken center stage, it remains unclear whether these approaches capture the heterogeneity of the PubMed database, a vast digital repository containing over 33 million articles. We introduce PubMed Graph Benchmark (PGB), a new benchmark dataset for evaluating heterogeneous graph embeddings for biomedical literature. PGB is one of the largest heterogeneous networks to date and consists of 30 million English articles. The benchmark contains rich metadata including abstract, authors, citations, MeSH terms, MeSH hierarchy, and some other information. The benchmark contains an evaluation task of 21 systematic reviews topics from 3 different datasets. In PGB, we aggregate the metadata associated with the biomedical articles from PubMed into a unified source and make the benchmark publicly available for any future works.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the field of document understanding has progressed a lot. A significant part of this progress has been possible thanks to the use of language models pretrained on large amounts of documents. However, pretraining corpora used in the domain of document understanding are single domain, monolingual, or nonpublic. Our goal in this paper is to propose an efficient pipeline for creating a big-scale, diverse, multilingual corpus of PDF files from all over the Internet using Common Crawl, as PDF files are the most canonical types of documents as considered in document understanding. We analysed extensively all of the steps of the pipeline and proposed a solution which is a trade-off between data quality and processing time. We also share a CCpdf corpus in a form or an index of PDF files along with a script for downloading them, which produces a collection useful for language model pretraining. The dataset and tools published with this paper offer researchers the opportunity to develop even better multilingual language models.",

    "title": "Evaluating Digital Library Search Systems by using Formal Process Modelling",
    "abstract": "Evaluations of digital library information systems are typically centred on users correctly, efficiently, and quickly performing predefined tasks. Additionally, users generally enjoy working with the evaluated system, and completed questionnaires show an interface's excellent user experience. However, such evaluations do not explicitly consider comparing or connecting user-specific information-seeking behaviour with digital library system capabilities and thus overlook actual user needs or further system requirements. We aim to close this gap by introducing the usage of formalisations of users' task conduction strategies to compare their information needs with the capabilities of such information systems. We observe users' strategies in scope of expert finding and paper search. We propose and investigate using the business process model notation to formalise task conduction strategies and the SchenQL digital library interface as an example system. We conduct interviews in a qualitative evaluation with 13 participants from various backgrounds from which we derive models. We discovered that the formalisations are suitable and helpful to mirror the strategies back to users and to compare users' ideal task conductions with capabilities of information systems. We conclude using formal models for qualitative digital library studies being a suitable mean to identify current limitations and depict users' task conduction strategies. Our published dataset containing the evaluation data can be reused to investigate other digital library systems' fit for depicting users' ideal task solutions.",

    "abstract": "Providing effective access paths to content is a key task in digital libraries. Oftentimes, such access paths are realized through advanced query languages, which, on the one hand, users may find challenging to learn or use, and on the other, requires libraries to convert their content into a high quality structured representation. As a remedy, narrative information access proposes to query library content through structured patterns directly, to ensure validity and coherence of information. However, users still find it challenging to express their information needs in such patterns. Therefore, this work bridges the gap by introducing a method that deduces patterns from keyword searches. Moreover, our user studies with participants from the biomedical domain show their acceptance of our prototypical system.",

    "abstract": "Detecting protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is crucial for understanding genetic mechanisms, disease pathogenesis, and drug design. However, with the fast-paced growth of biomedical literature, there is a growing need for automated and accurate extraction of PPIs to facilitate scientific knowledge discovery. Pre-trained language models, such as generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) and bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT), have shown promising results in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. We evaluated the PPI identification performance of various GPT and BERT models using a manually curated benchmark corpus of 164 PPIs in 77 sentences from learning language in logic (LLL). BERT-based models achieved the best overall performance, with PubMedBERT achieving the highest precision (85.17%) and F1-score (86.47%) and BioM-ALBERT achieving the highest recall (93.83%). Despite not being explicitly trained for biomedical texts, GPT-4 achieved comparable performance to the best BERT models with 83.34% precision, 76.57% recall, and 79.18% F1-score. These findings suggest that GPT models can effectively detect PPIs from text data and have the potential for use in biomedical literature mining tasks.",

    "abstract": "Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) play a major role in aiding biomedical research and practices. To inform this research, the demand for highly accurate retrieval of scientific articles on RCT research has grown in recent decades. However, correctly identifying all published RCTs in a given domain is a non-trivial task, which has motivated computer scientists to develop methods for identifying papers involving RCTs. Although existing studies have provided invaluable insights into how RCT tags can be predicted for biomedicine research articles, they used datasets from different sources in varying sizes and timeframes and their models and findings cannot be compared across studies. In addition, as datasets and code are rarely shared, researchers who conduct RCT classification have to write code from scratch, reinventing the wheel. In this paper, we present Bat4RCT, a suite of data and an integrated method to serve as a strong baseline for RCT classification, which includes the use of BERT-based models in comparison with conventional machine learning techniques. To validate our approach, all models are applied on 500,000 paper records in MEDLINE. The BERT-based models showed consistently higher recall scores than conventional machine learning and CNN models while producing slightly better or similar precision scores. The best performance was achieved by the BioBERT model when trained on both title and abstract texts, with the F1 score of 90.85%. This infrastructure of dataset and code will provide a competitive baseline for the evaluation and comparison of new methods and the convenience of future benchmarking. To our best knowledge, our study is the first work to apply BERT-based language modeling techniques to RCT classification tasks and to share dataset and code in order to promote reproducibility and improvement in text classification in biomedicine research.",

    "abstract": "The COVID 19 pandemic has paused many ongoing research projects and unified researchers' attention to focus on COVID 19 related issues. Our project traces 712294 scientists' publications related to COVID 19 for two years, from January 2020 to December 2021, to detect the dynamic evolution patterns of the COVID 19 collaboration network over time. By studying the collaboration network of COVID 19 scientists, we observe how a new scientific community has been built in preparation for a sudden shock. The number of newcomers grows incrementally, and the connectivity of the collaboration network shifts from loose to tight promptly. Even though every scientist has an equal opportunity to start a study, collaboration disparity still exists. Following the scale-free distribution, only a few top authors are highly connected with other authors. These top authors are more likely to attract newcomers and work with each other. As the collaboration network evolves, the increase rate in the probability of attracting newcomers for authors with higher degrees increases, whereas the increase rates in the likelihood of forming new links among authors with higher degrees decreases. This highlights the interesting trend that the COVID pandemic alters the research collaboration trends that star scientists are starting to collaborate more with newcomers but less with existing collaborators, which, in a certain way, reduces the collaboration disparity.",

Although the effect is reduced in the out-of-domain field and not the the trained domain thus representing a limitation, it is difficult to train a new language model for a specific domain since it is both time-consuming and requires large amounts of data. We propose a method to quickly and effectively apply the pre-trained language models trained in the general domain to a specific domain\u2019s vocabulary without re-training. An extended vocabulary list is obtained by extracting a meaningful wordpiece from the training data of the downstream task. We introduce curriculum learning, training the models with two successive updates, to adapt the embedding value of the new vocabulary. It is convenient to apply because all training of the models for downstream tasks are performed in one run. To confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conducted experiments on AIDA-SC, AIDA-FC, and KLUE-TC, which are Korean classification tasks, and subsequently achieved stable performance improvement.",

    "abstract": "Due to the exponential growth of scientific publications on the Web, there is a pressing need to tag each paper with fine-grained topics so that researchers can track their interested fields of study rather than drowning in the whole literature. Scientific literature tagging is beyond a pure multi-label text classification task because papers on the Web are prevalently accompanied by metadata information such as venues, authors, and references, which may serve as additional signals to infer relevant tags. Although there have been studies making use of metadata in academic paper classification, their focus is often restricted to one or two scientific fields (e.g., computer science and biomedicine) and to one specific model. In this work, we systematically study the effect of metadata on scientific literature tagging across 19 fields. We select three representative multi-label classifiers (i.e., a bag-of-words model, a sequence-based model, and a pre-trained language model) and explore their performance change in scientific literature tagging when metadata are fed to the classifiers as additional features. We observe some ubiquitous patterns of metadata\u2019s effects across all fields (e.g., venues are consistently beneficial to paper tagging in almost all cases), as well as some unique patterns in fields other than computer science and biomedicine, which are not explored in previous studies.",

It performs convolutions based on the multi-hop simplicial adjacencies via common faces and cofaces independently and captures the inter-simplicial couplings, gen-eralizing state-of-the-art. Upon studying symmetries of the simplicial domain and the data space, it is shown to be permutation and orientation equivariant, thus, incorporating such inductive biases. Based on the Hodge theory, we perform a spectral analysis to understand how SCCNNs regulate data in different frequencies, showing that the convolutions via faces and cofaces operate in two orthogonal data spaces. Lastly, we study the stability of SCCNNs to domain deformations and examine the effects of various factors. Empirical results show the bene\ufb01ts of higher-order convolutions and inter-simplicial couplings in simplex prediction and trajectory prediction.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, the problem of wireless resource allocation and semantic information extraction for energy efficient semantic communications over wireless networks with rate splitting is investigated. In the considered model, a base station (BS) first extracts semantic information from its large-scale data, and then transmits the small-sized semantic information to each user which recovers the original data based on its local common knowledge. At the BS side, the probability graph is used to extract multi-level semantic information. In the downlink transmission, a rate splitting scheme is adopted, while the private small-sized semantic information is transmitted through private message and the common knowledge is transmitted through common message. Due to limited wireless resource, both computation energy and transmission energy are considered. This joint computation and communication problem is formulated as an optimization problem aiming to minimize the total communication and computation energy consumption of the network under computation, latency, and transmit power constraints. To solve this problem, an alternating algorithm is proposed where the closed-form solutions for semantic information extraction ratio and computation frequency are obtained at each step. Numerical results verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",

    "abstract": "The fast development of science and technology is accompanied by the booming of cutting edge research. Researchers need to digest more and more recently published publications in order to keep themselves up to date. This becomes tough in particular with the prevalence of preprint publishing such as arXiv, where inspiring works could come out without being peer-reviewed. Is that possible to design an automatic system to help researchers quickly gain a glimpse of a piece of work or gain useful background knowledge for deeply understanding it? To this end, we proposed a practical framework called Master Reading Tree (MRT) to trace the evolution of scientific publications. In this framework, we can build annotated evolution roadmaps for publications and identify important previous works or evolution tracks by generating expressive embeddings and clustering them into various groups. With comprehensive evaluations, our proposed framework demonstrates its superior capability in capturing underlying relations behind publications over several baseline algorithms. Finally, we integrated the proposed MRT framework on AMiner, an online academic platform, where users can generate roadmaps using MRT for free and their interactions are further used to refine the model.",

    "abstract": "MEDLINE is the National Library of Medicine's (NLM) journal citation database. It contains over 28 million references to biomedical and life science journal articles, and a key feature of the database is that all articles are indexed with NLM Medical Subject Headings (MeSH). The library employs a team of MeSH indexers, and in recent years they have been asked to index close to 1 million articles per year in order to keep MEDLINE up to date. An important part of the MEDLINE indexing process is the assignment of articles to indexers. High quality and timely indexing is only possible when articles are assigned to indexers with suitable expertise. This article introduces the NLM indexer assignment dataset: a large dataset of 4.2 million indexer article assignments for articles indexed between 2011 and 2019. The dataset is shown to be a valuable testbed for expert matching and assignment algorithms, and indexer article assignment is also found to be useful domain\u2010adaptive pre\u2010training for the closely related task of reviewer assignment.",

    "title": "Automating Quality Assessment of Medical Evidence in Systematic Reviews: Model Development and Validation Study",
    "abstract": "Background Assessment of the quality of medical evidence available on the web is a critical step in the preparation of systematic reviews. Existing tools that automate parts of this task validate the quality of individual studies but not of entire bodies of evidence and focus on a restricted set of quality criteria. Objective We proposed a quality assessment task that provides an overall quality rating for each body of evidence (BoE), as well as finer-grained justification for different quality criteria according to the Grading of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation formalization framework. For this purpose, we constructed a new data set and developed a machine learning baseline system (EvidenceGRADEr). Methods We algorithmically extracted quality-related data from all summaries of findings found in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Each BoE was defined by a set of population, intervention, comparison, and outcome criteria and assigned a quality grade (high, moderate, low, or very low) together with quality criteria (justification) that influenced that decision. Different statistical data, metadata about the review, and parts of the review text were extracted as support for grading each BoE. After pruning the resulting data set with various quality checks, we used it to train several neural-model variants. The predictions were compared against the labels originally assigned by the authors of the systematic reviews. Results Our quality assessment data set, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Quality of Evidence, contains 13,440 instances, or BoEs labeled for quality, originating from 2252 systematic reviews published on the internet from 2002 to 2020. On the basis of a 10-fold cross-validation, the best neural binary classifiers for quality criteria detected risk of bias at 0.78 F1 (P=.68; R=0.92) and imprecision at 0.75 F1 (P=.66; R=0.86), while the performance on inconsistency, indirectness, and publication bias criteria was lower (F1 in the range of 0.3-0.4). The prediction of the overall quality grade into 1 of the 4 levels resulted in 0.5 F1. When casting the task as a binary problem by merging the Grading of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation classes (high+moderate vs low+very low-quality evidence), we attained 0.74 F1. We also found that the results varied depending on the supporting information that is provided as an input to the models. Conclusions Different factors affect the quality of evidence in the context of systematic reviews of medical evidence. Some of these (risk of bias and imprecision) can be automated with reasonable accuracy. Other quality dimensions such as indirectness, inconsistency, and publication bias prove more challenging for machine learning, largely because they are much rarer. This technology could substantially reduce reviewer workload in the future and expedite quality assessment as part of evidence synthesis.",

    "abstract": "In the last few years, chatbots have become mainstream solutions adopted in a variety of domains for automatizing communication at scale. In the same period, knowledge graphs have attracted significant attention from business and academia as robust and scalable representations of information. In the scientific and academic research domain, they are increasingly used to illustrate the relevant actors (e.g., researchers, institutions), documents (e.g., articles, patents), entities (e.g., concepts, innovations), and other related information. Following the same direction, this paper describes how to integrate conversational agents with knowledge graphs focused on the scholarly domain, a.k.a. Scientific Knowledge Graphs. On top of the proposed architecture, we developed AIDA-Bot, a simple chatbot that leverages a large-scale knowledge graph of scholarly data. AIDA-Bot can answer natural language questions about scientific articles, research concepts, researchers, institutions, and research venues. We have developed four prototypes of AIDA-Bot on Alexa products, web browsers, Telegram clients, and humanoid robots. We performed a user study evaluation with 15 domain experts showing a high level of interest and engagement with the proposed agent.",

    "abstract": "Scientific progress, or scientific change, has been an important topic in the philosophy and history of science. Previous work has developed quantitative approaches to characterize the progression of science in different fields, but how individual scientists make progress through their careers is not well understood at a comprehensive scale. We characterize the regularity in the temporal dynamics of scientists\u2019 publishing behavior with computational algorithms that predict the historical emerging order of publications from individual scientists. We discover that scientists publish in ways following the processes of chaining that mirror those observed in historical word meaning extension, whereby novel ideas emerge by connecting to existing ideas that are proximal in semantic space. We report findings for predominant exemplar-based chaining that reconstructs the emerging order in the publications of 1,164 award-winning and random-sampled scientists from the fields of Physics, Chemistry, Medicine, Economics, and Computer Science over the past century. Our work provides large-scale evidence that scientists across different fields tend to share similar publishing behavior over time by taking incremental steps that build on their past research outputs.",

    "abstract": "The foundation of the study of medical texts and one of the primary information extraction sub-activities is biomedical named entity recognition (BioNER) which brings out important named structures such as diseases, gene, protein, species etc. from biomedical text. Although the BioNER task is fairly comparable to regular NER, it is more difficult to identify biological named entities because of their unique nomenclatural features. In this regard, we present an architecture for neural network using transfer learning with the fusion of pre-trained SciBERT language model and bidirectional long short term memory (BiLSTM). First, the paradigm uses SciBERT, which performs better on biomedical tasks than BERT base, and a Bi-LSTM network in order to gather more comprehensive context data. Ultimately a conditional random field (CRF) layer combined with Bi-LSTM is used to model the dependency between each state and the entire input sequences. At the end, we have evaluated our system on a benchmark dataset named NCBI-Disease corpus. The suggested model has a competitive effectiveness for the NCBI-Disease possessing a 91.00% f1-score, 89.00% precision, 93.00% recall, and 98.00% accuracy. Therefore, with the usage of pre-trained SciBERT model and no feature engineering, our methodology can improve the neural network\u2019s capacity to extract significant information.",

This introduces the need for new food NER and NEL models, developed specifically for extracting food entities from scientific text. In this paper, we present a scientific food NER and NEL model, SciFoodNER, obtained by fine-tuning transformer models on a corpus of scientific abstracts annotated with food entities. The models can identify mentions of food entites from raw text, and link the food entities to the Hansard Taxonomy, the FoodOn ontology and the Systematised Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMEDCT). Out of the evaluated models, the BioBERT model achieves the best results, reaching a median macro-averaged F1 score of 0.90 for the NER task, 0.66 for the NEL task linking to the Hansard Taxonomy, 0.43 for the NEL task linking to the FoodOn ontology and 0.58 for the NEL task linking to the SNOMEDCT ontology.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Informal knowledge constantly transitions into formal domain knowledge in the dynamic knowledge base. This article focuses on an integrative understanding of the knowledge role transition from the perspective of knowledge codification. The transition process is characterized by several dynamics involving a variety of bibliometric entities, such as authors, keywords, institutions, and venues. We thereby designed a series of temporal and cumulative indicators to respectively explore transition possibility (whether new knowledge could be transitioned into formal knowledge) and transition pace (how long it would take). By analyzing the large-scale metadata of publications that contain informal knowledge and formal knowledge in the PubMed database, we find that multidimensional variables are essential to comprehensively understand knowledge role transition. More significantly, early funding support is more important for improving transition pace; journal impact has a positive correlation with the transition possibility but a negative correlation with transition pace; and weaker knowledge relatedness raises the transition possibility, whereas stronger knowledge relatedness improves the transition pace.",

    "abstract": "The rapidly growing volume of scientific publications offers an interesting challenge for research on methods for analyzing the authorship of documents with one or more authors. However, most existing datasets lack scientific documents or the necessary metadata for constructing new experiments and test cases. We introduce SMAuC, a comprehensive, metadata-rich corpus tailored to scientific authorship analysis. Comprising over 3 million publications across various disciplines from over 5 million authors, SMAuC is the largest openly accessible corpus for this purpose. It encompasses scientific texts from humanities and natural sciences, accompanied by extensive, curated metadata, including unambiguous author IDs. SMAuC aims to significantly advance the domain of authorship analysis in scientific texts.",

    "abstract": "Pre-trained language models have achieved promising performance on general benchmarks, but underperform when migrated to a specific domain. Recent works perform pre-training from scratch or continual pre-training on domain corpora. However, in many specific domains, the limited corpus can hardly support obtaining precise representations. To address this issue, we propose a novel Transformer-based language model named VarMAE for domain-adaptive language understanding. Under the masked autoencoding objective, we design a context uncertainty learning module to encode the token's context into a smooth latent distribution. The module can produce diverse and well-formed contextual representations. Experiments on science- and finance-domain NLU tasks demonstrate that VarMAE can be efficiently adapted to new domains with limited resources.",

    "abstract": "With the massive increase in the number of research papers, it becomes difficult for researchers to keep track of the current state of research. Unlike the current classification methods that use citation intent, from a reverse perspective, we propose a method to Classify Citation Relationships based on the Contributions of Cited papers. This classification method can count the number of citations for each contribution, which can be used as a feature of a paper summarization system to generate a summary. Since the number of citations changes over time, the generated paper summary is dynamic. It can also generate a citation summary based on the citations of each contribution. We build a dataset for this method called C2RC2. We achieve an accuracy of 0.7896 on the test set using the SciBERT model, which indicates that it is feasible to classify citation relations by the contributions of cited papers.",

    "abstract": "Semantic communication enables intelligent agents to extract meaning (or semantics) of information via interaction, to carry out collaborative tasks. In this paper, we study semantic communication from a topological space perspective, in which higher-order data semantics live in a simplicial complex. Specifically, a transmitter first maps its data into a k-order simplicial complex and then learns its high-order correlations. The simplicial structure and corresponding features are encoded into semantic embeddings in latent space for transmission. Subsequently, the receiver decodes the structure and infers the missing or distorted data. The transmitter and receiver collaboratively train a simplicial convolutional autoencoder to accomplish the semantic communication task. Experiments are carried out on a real dataset of Semantic Scholar Open Research Corpus, where one part of the semantic embedding is missing or distorted during communication. Numerical results show that the simplicial convolutional autoencoder enabled semantic communication effectively rebuilds the simplicial features and infer the missing data with 95% accuracy, while achieving stable performance under channel noise. In contrast, the conventional autoencoder enabled communication fails to infer any missing data. Moreover, our approach is shown to effectively infer the distorted data without prior simplicial structure knowledge at the receiver, by learning extracted semantic information during communications. Leveraging the topological nature of information, the proposed method is also shown to be more reliable and efficient compared to several baselines, notably at low signal-to-noise (SNR) levels.",

    "abstract": "In this article, we aim to analyse the nature and epistemic consequences of what figures in network science as patterns of nodes and edges called 'communities'. Tracing these patterns as multi-faceted and ambivalent, we propose to describe the concept of community as a 'vague operator', a variant of Susan Leigh Star's notion of the boundary object, and propose that the ability to construct different modes of description that are both vague in some registers and hyper-precise in others, is core both to digital politics and the analysis of 'communities'. Engaging with these formations in terms drawn from mathematics and software studies enables a wider mapping of their formation. Disentangling different lineages in network science then allows us to contextualise the founding account of 'community' popularised by Michelle Girvan and Mark Newman in 2002. After studying one particular community detection algorithm, the widely-used 'Louvain algorithm', we comment on controversies arising with some of their more ambiguous applications. We argue that 'community' can act as a real abstraction with the power to reshape social relations such as producing echo chambers in social networking sites. To rework the epistemological terms of community detection and propose a reconsideration of vague operators, we draw on debates and propositions within the literature of network science to imagine a 'critical heuristics' that embraces partiality, epistemic humbleness, reflexivity and artificiality.",

    "abstract": ". When semantically describing knowledge graphs (KGs), users have to make a critical choice of a vocabulary (i.e. predicates and re-sources). The success of KG building is determined by the convergence of shared vocabularies so that meaning can be established. The typical lifecycle for a new KG construction can be de\ufb01ned as follows: nascent phases of graph construction experience terminology divergence, while later phases of graph construction experience terminology convergence and reuse. In this paper, we describe our approach tailoring two AI-based clustering algorithms for recommending predicates (in RDF statements) about resources in the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG) https://orkg.org/. Such a service to recommend existing predicates to semantify new incoming data of scholarly publications is of paramount importance for fostering terminology convergence in the ORKG. Our experiments show very promising results: a high precision with relatively high recall in linear runtime performance. Furthermore, this work o\ufb00ers novel insights into the predicate groups that automatically accrue loosely as generic semanti\ufb01cation patterns for semanti\ufb01cation of scholarly knowledge spanning 44 research \ufb01elds.",

We conduct a study to characterize the semantic content of alt text in HCI publications based on a framework introduced by Lundgard and Satyanarayan [30]. Our study focuses on alt text for graphs, charts, and plots extracted from HCI and accessibility publications; we focus on these communities due to the lack of alt text in papers published outside of these disciplines. We find that the capacity of author-written alt text to fulfill blind and low vision user needs is mixed; for example, only 50% of alt texts in our sample contain information about extrema or outliers, and only 31% contain information about major trends or comparisons conveyed by the graph. We release our collected dataset of author-written alt text, and outline possible ways that it can be used to develop tools and models to assist future authors in writing better alt text. Based on our findings, we also discuss recommendations that can be acted upon by publishers and authors to encourage inclusion of more types of semantic content in alt text.",

    "abstract": "Creating and maintaining a domain-specific database of research institutions, academic experts and scholarly literature is essential to expanding national marine science and technology. Knowledge graphs (KGs) have now been widely used in both industry and academia to address real-world problems. Despite the abundance of generic KGs, there is a vital need to build domain-specific knowledge graphs in the marine sciences domain. In addition, there is still not an effective method for named entity recognition when constructing a knowledge graph, especially when including data from both scientific and social media sources. This article presents a novel marine science domain-based knowledge graph framework. This framework involves capturing marine domain data into KG representations. The proposed approach utilizes various entity information based on marine domain experts to enrich the semantic content of the knowledge graph. To enhance named entity recognition accuracy, we propose a novel TrellisNet-CRF model. Our experiment results demonstrate that the TrellisNet-CRF model reached a 96.99% accuracy rate for marine domain named entity recognition, which outperforms the current state-of-the-art baseline. The effectiveness of the TrellisNet-CRF module was then further demonstrated and confirmed on entity recognition and visualization tasks.",

    "abstract": "Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) happen when two or more drugs interact. DDIs may change the effect of drugs in the body which can induce adverse effects and severe diseases for patients. As a result, detecting the interaction between drugs is essential. In the last years, many new DDIs have been found and added to the medical datasets with the rise in the number of discovered drugs. On the other hand, since a lot of this information is still in Biomedical articles and sources, there is a need for a method to extract DDIs information. However, despite the development of many techniques, attaining good prediction accuracy is the main issue. This paper proposes a deep learning approach that: 1) uses the power of Relation BioBERT (R-BioBERT) to detect and classify the DDIs and 2) employs the Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory (BLSTM) to further increase the prediction quality. Not only does this paper study whether the two drugs have an interaction or not, but it also studies specific types of interactions between drugs. The paper also provides that using BLSTM can significantly increase the F-scores compared to the baseline model on the famous SemEval 2013, TAC 2018, and TAC 2019 DDI Extraction datasets.",

    "abstract": "With expedition of huge number of research articles published in each domain, retrieval of relevant articles based on researcher's interest and requirement have become challenging. Further, there are circumstances where a researcher may not get the specific information sought after, regardless of whether it is there in the document collection. This is since the article in database is structured only based on title and citation data while the conceptual information and algorithms described inside an article are disregarded. In this work, we propose a useful methodology for re-structuring documents in the database by considering the document as a whole and representing the keywords and key-phrases extracted from the article data using Knowledge Graphs. Clustering of nodes of graph segregate articles into different domains and sub-domains. Knowledge graph is further explored to identify most important documents using modularity and then the documents are sorted based on relevance. Thus, proper structuring of the documents helps the researchers to recognize applicable content from a large database in short span of time since database associated with the query system is improvised. This technique is beneficial to all the researchers who are trying to resolve a problem by identifying apt documents for information need.",

    "title": "Performance Optimization for Semantic Communications: An Attention-Based Reinforcement Learning Approach",
    "abstract": "In this paper, a semantic communication framework is proposed for textual data transmission. In the studied model, a base station (BS) extracts the semantic information from textual data, and transmits it to each user. The semantic information is modeled by a knowledge graph (KG) that consists of a set of semantic triples. After receiving the semantic information, each user recovers the original text using a graph-to-text generation model. To measure the performance of the considered semantic communication framework, a metric of semantic similarity (MSS) that jointly captures the semantic accuracy and completeness of the recovered text is proposed. Due to wireless resource limitations, the BS may not be able to transmit the entire semantic information to each user and satisfy the transmission delay constraint. Hence, the BS must select an appropriate resource block for each user as well as determine and transmit part of the semantic information to the users. As such, we formulate an optimization problem whose goal is to maximize the total MSS by jointly optimizing the resource allocation policy and determining the partial semantic information to be transmitted. To solve this problem, a proximal-policy-optimization-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm integrated with an attention network is proposed. The proposed algorithm can evaluate the importance of each triple in the semantic information using an attention network and then, build a relationship between the importance distribution of the triples in the semantic information and the total MSS. Compared to traditional RL algorithms, the proposed algorithm can dynamically adjust its learning rate thus ensuring convergence to a locally optimal solution. Simulation results show that the proposed framework can reduce by 41.3% data that the BS needs to transmit and improve by two-fold the total MSS compared to a standard communication network without using semantic communication techniques.",

    "abstract": "Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are the prevalent interaction method for software modules, components, and systems. As systems and APIs evolve, an API element may be marked as deprecated, indicating that its use is disapproved or that the feature will be removed in an upcoming version. Consequently, deprecation is a means of communication between developers and, ideally, complemented by further documentation, including suggestions for the developers of the API\u2019s clients.API deprecation is a relatively young research area that recently gained traction among researchers. To identify the current state of research as well as to identify open research areas, a meta-study that assesses scientific studies is necessary. Therefore, this paper presents a systematic mapping study on API deprecation to classify the state of the art and identify gaps in the research field. We identified and mapped 36 primary studies into a classification scheme comprising general and API-specific categories.We identified five major gaps in previous research on API deprecation as opportunities for future studies: studying remote APIs, investigating a broader range of static APIs, joining suppliers\u2019 and clients\u2019 views, including humans in studies, and avoiding deprecation.",

    "abstract": "Decentralization is a widespread concept across disciplines such as Economics, Political Science and Computer Science, which use it in distinct but overlapping ways. Here, we investigate the scholarly history of the term by analysing 425 k academic publications mentioning (de)centralization. We reveal that the fraction of papers on the topic has been exponentially increasing since the 1950s, with 1 author in 154 contributing to a paper on (de)centralization in 2021. We then cluster papers using both semantic and citation information and show that the topic has independently emerged in di\ufb00erent \ufb01elds, while cross-disciplinary contamination started only more recently. Finally, focusing on the two most prominent clusters by number of papers and in\ufb02uence, we show how Blockchain has become the most in\ufb02uential \ufb01eld about 10 years ago, while Governance dominated before the 1990s, and we characterize their interactions with other \ufb01elds. Our results add a quantitative dimension to the history of a key yet elusive concept. Furthermore, the introduced framework is general and our publicly released pipeline may be used to run similar analyses on other concepts in the academic literature. keywords and the hierarchical tree resulting from the clustering algorithm.",

We reconceptualize and pilot beneficial AI to radically augment human understanding by complementing rather than competing with human cognitive capacity. Our approach to complementary intelligence builds on insights underlying the wisdom of crowds, which hinges on the independence and diversity of crowd members\u2019 information and approach. By programmatically incorporating information on the evolving distribution of scientific expertise from research papers, our approach follows the distribution of content in the literature while avoiding the scientific crowd and the hypotheses cognitively available to it. We use this approach to generate valuable predictions for what materials possess valuable energy-related properties (e.g., thermoelectricity), and what compounds possess valuable medical properties (e.g., asthma) that complement the human scientific crowd. We demonstrate that our complementary predictions, if identified by human scientists and inventors at all, are only discovered years further into the future. When we evaluate the promise of our predictions with first-principles or data-driven simulations of those properties, we demonstrate an \u201cexpectation gap\u201d such that increased complementarity of our predictions do not decrease and in some cases increase the probability of these properties above those discovered and published by human scientists. In summary, by tuning AI to avoid the crowd, we can generate hypotheses unlikely to be imagined or pursued without intervention until the distant future that promise to punctuate scientific advance. By identifying and correcting for collective human bias, these models also suggest opportunities to improve human prediction by reformulating science education for discovery.",

    "abstract": "Writing a survey paper on one research topic usually needs to cover the salient content from numerous related papers, which can be modeled as a multi-document summarization (MDS) task. Existing MDS datasets usually focus on producing the structureless summary covering a few input documents. Meanwhile, previous structured summary generation works focus on summarizing a single document into a multi-section summary. These existing datasets and methods cannot meet the requirements of summarizing numerous academic papers into a structured summary. To deal with the scarcity of available data, we propose BigSurvey, the first large-scale dataset for generating comprehensive summaries of numerous academic papers on each topic. We collect target summaries from more than seven thousand survey papers and utilize their 430 thousand reference papers\u2019 abstracts as input documents. To organize the diverse content from dozens of input documents and ensure the efficiency of processing long text sequences, we propose a summarization method named category-based alignment and sparse transformer (CAST). The experimental results show that our CAST method outperforms various advanced summarization methods.",

    "abstract": "Coastal settlements are experiencing the effects of climate change\u2010induced sea\u2010level rise, including a significant but often poorly\u2010characterized impact on groundwater. The shallow water tables present in the built coastal environment contribute to an increased risk from natural hazards such as groundwater flooding and saltwater intrusion. Historical urban development was accompanied by impacts on shallow groundwater, and in the future subsurface environments, including underground infrastructure, will face additional pressure. This article reviews processes of the coastal groundwater zone and simulation tools used to evaluate possible impacts of sea\u2010level rise. The benefits and limitations of the two main methods to assess coastal groundwater rise and contribution to flooding are discussed using studies and investigations up to 2021. The review addresses challenges associated with the simulation tools to evaluate changes in urban hydrogeology due to sea\u2010level rise. The models reviewed do not specifically estimate groundwater contribution to land\u2010surface flooding. We highlight a critical need for methodology comparisons between spatial interpolation and numerical tools that will guide future work. An adequate validation of assessment methods is required and will be supported by improved coastal groundwater monitoring networks focused on water quality, saltwater intrusion, and continuous groundwater levels records. From current monitoring practices, evidence for groundwater rise with rising sea level is not widely observed at present. New monitoring sites are recommended near the coastline and tidally influenced surface water bodies, to better evaluate the rise of the water table and impacts on infrastructure.",

    "abstract": "In scientometrics, scientific collaboration is often analyzed by means of co-authorships. An aspect which is often overlooked and more difficult to quantify is the flow of expertise between authors from different research topics, which is an important part of scientific progress. With the Topic Flow Network (TFN) we propose a graph structure for the analysis of research topic flows between scientific authors and their respective research fields. Based on a multi-graph and a topic model, our proposed network structure accounts for intratopic as well as intertopic flows. Our method requires for the construction of a TFN solely a corpus of publications (i.e., author and abstract information). From this, research topics are discovered automatically through non-negative matrix factorization. The thereof derived TFN allows for the application of social network analysis techniques, such as common metrics and community detection. Most importantly, it allows for the analysis of intertopic flows on a large, macroscopic scale, i.e., between research topic, as well as on a microscopic scale, i.e., between certain sets of authors. We demonstrate the utility of TFNs by applying our method to two comprehensive corpora of altogether 20 Mio. publications spanning more than 60 years of research in the fields computer science and mathematics. Our results give evidence that Topic Flow Networks are suitable, e.g., for the analysis of topical communities, the discovery of important authors in different fields, and, most notably, the analysis of intertopic flows, i.e., the transfer of topical expertise. Besides that, our method opens new directions for future research, such as the investigation of influence relationships between research fields.",

    "title": "A Scoping Review of Species Distribution Modeling Methods for Tick Vectors",
    "abstract": "Background Globally, tick-borne disease is a pervasive and worsening problem that impacts human and domestic animal health, livelihoods, and numerous economies. Species distribution models are useful tools to help address these issues, but many different modeling approaches and environmental data sources exist. Objective We conducted a scoping review that examined all available research employing species distribution models to predict occurrence and map tick species to understand the diversity of model strategies, environmental predictors, tick data sources, frequency of climate projects of tick ranges, and types of model validation methods. Design Following the PRISMA-ScR checklist, we searched scientific databases for eligible articles, their references, and explored related publications through a graphical tool (www.connectedpapers.com). Two independent reviewers performed article selection and characterization using a priori criteria. Results We describe data collected from 107 peer-reviewed articles that met our inclusion criteria. The literature reflects that tick species distributions have been modeled predominantly in North America and Europe and have mostly modeled the habitat suitability for Ixodes ricinus (n = 23; 21.5%). A wide range of bioclimatic databases and other environmental correlates were utilized among models, but the WorldClim database and its bioclimatic variables 1\u201319 appeared in 60 (56%) papers. The most frequently chosen modeling approach was MaxEnt, which also appeared in 60 (56%) of papers. Despite the importance of ensemble modeling to reduce bias, only 23 papers (21.5%) employed more than one algorithm, and just six (5.6%) used an ensemble approach that incorporated at least five different modeling methods for comparison. Area under the curve/receiver operating characteristic was the most frequently reported model validation method, utilized in nearly all (98.9%) included studies. Only 21% of papers used future climate scenarios to predict tick range expansion or contraction. Regardless of the representative concentration pathway, six of seven genera were expected to both expand and retract depending on location, while Ornithodoros was predicted to only expand beyond its current range. Conclusion Species distribution modeling techniques are useful and widely employed tools for predicting tick habitat suitability and range movement. However, the vast array of methods, data sources, and validation strategies within the SDM literature support the need for standardized protocols for species distribution and ecological niche modeling for tick vectors.",

    "abstract": "A long-running goal of the clinical NLP community is the extraction of important variables trapped in clinical notes. However, roadblocks have included dataset shift from the general domain and a lack of public clinical corpora and annotations. In this work, we show that large language models, such as InstructGPT (Ouyang et al., 2022), perform well at zero- and few-shot information extraction from clinical text despite not being trained specifically for the clinical domain. Whereas text classification and generation performance have already been studied extensively in such models, here we additionally demonstrate how to leverage them to tackle a diverse set of NLP tasks which require more structured outputs, including span identification, token-level sequence classification, and relation extraction. Further, due to the dearth of available data to evaluate these systems, we introduce new datasets for benchmarking few-shot clinical information extraction based on a manual re-annotation of the CASI dataset (Moon et al., 2014) for new tasks. On the clinical extraction tasks we studied, the GPT-3 systems significantly outperform existing zero- and few-shot baselines.",

    "abstract": "We are faced with an unprecedented production in scholarly publications worldwide. Stakeholders in the digital libraries posit that the document-based publishing paradigm has reached the limits of adequacy. Instead, structured, machine-interpretable, fine-grained scholarly knowledge publishing as Knowledge Graphs (KG) is strongly advocated. In this work, we develop and analyze a large-scale structured dataset of STEM articles across 10 different disciplines, viz. Agriculture, Astronomy, Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Earth Science, Engineering, Material Science, Mathematics, and Medicine. Our analysis is defined over a large-scale corpus comprising 60K abstracts structured as four scientific entities process, method, material, and data. Thus, our study presents, for the first time, an analysis of a large-scale multidisciplinary corpus under the construct of four named entity labels that are specifically defined and selected to be domain-independent as opposed to domain-specific. The work is then inadvertently a feasibility test of characterizing multidisciplinary science with domain-independent concepts. Further, to summarize the distinct facets of scientific knowledge per concept per discipline, a set of word cloud visualizations are offered. The STEM-NER-60k corpus, created in this work, comprises over 1 M extracted entities from 60k STEM articles obtained from a major publishing platform and is publicly released.",

In this process, we created the largest and most diverse scienti\ufb01c language model to date, ScholarBERT, by training a 770M-parameter BERT model on an 221B token scienti\ufb01c literature dataset spanning many disciplines. Counterintuitively, our evaluation of the 14 BERT-based models (seven versions of ScholarBERT, \ufb01ve science-speci\ufb01c large language models from the literature, BERT-Base, and BERT-Large) reveals little difference in performance across the 11 science-focused tasks, despite major differences in model size and training data.

    "title": "Medical Coding with Biomedical Transformer Ensembles and Zero/Few-shot Learning",
    "abstract": "Medical coding (MC) is an essential pre-requisite for reliable data retrieval and reporting. Given a free-text reported term (RT) such as \u201cpain of right thigh to the knee\u201d, the task is to identify the matching lowest-level term (LLT) \u2013in this case \u201cunilateral leg pain\u201d\u2013 from a very large and continuously growing repository of standardized medical terms. However, automating this task is challenging due to a large number of LLT codes (as of writing over 80\\,000), limited availability of training data for long tail/emerging classes, and the general high accuracy demands of the medical domain.With this paper, we introduce the MC task, discuss its challenges, and present a novel approach called xTARS that combines traditional BERT-based classification with a recent zero/few-shot learning approach (TARS). We present extensive experiments that show that our combined approach outperforms strong baselines, especially in the few-shot regime. The approach is developed and deployed at Bayer, live since November 2021. As we believe our approach potentially promising beyond MC, and to ensure reproducibility, we release the code to the research community.",

    "abstract": "Steadily growing amounts of information, such as annually published scienti\ufb01c papers, have become so large that they elude an extensive manual analysis. Hence, to maintain an overview, automated methods for the mapping and visualization of knowledge domains are necessary and important, e.g., for scienti\ufb01c decision makers. Of particular interest in this \ufb01eld is the development of research topics of di\ufb00erent entities (e.g., scienti\ufb01c authors and venues) over time. However, existing approaches for their analysis are only suitable for single entity types, such as venues, and they often do not capture the research topics or the time dimension in an easily interpretable manner. Hence, we propose a principled approach for mapping research trajectories , which is applicable to all kinds of scienti\ufb01c entities that can be represented by sets of published papers. For this, we transfer ideas and principles from the geographic visualization domain, speci\ufb01cally trajectory maps and interactive geographic maps. Our visualizations depict the research topics of entities over time in a straightforward interpretable manner. They can be navigated by the user intuitively and restricted to speci\ufb01c elements of interest. The maps are derived from a corpus of research publications (i.e., titles and abstracts) through a combination of unsupervised machine learning methods. In a practical demonstrator application, we exemplify the proposed approach on a publication corpus from machine learning. We observe that our trajectory visualizations of 30 top machine learning venues and \u223c 1000 major authors in this \ufb01eld are well interpretable and are consistent with background knowledge drawn from the entities\u2019 publications. Next to producing interactive, interpretable visualizations supporting di\ufb00erent kinds of analyses, our computed trajectories are suitable for trajectory mining applications in the future.",

    "abstract": "Authors publish documents in a dynamic manner. Their topic of interest and writing style might shift over time. Tasks such as author classification, author identification or link prediction are difficult to solve in such complex data settings. We propose a new representation learning model, DGEA (for Dynamic Gaussian Embedding of Authors), that is more suited to solve these tasks by capturing this temporal evolution. We formulate a general embedding framework: author representation at time t is a Gaussian distribution that leverages pre-trained document vectors, and that depends on the publications observed until t. The representations should retain some form of multi-topic information and temporal smoothness. We propose two models that fit into this framework. The first one, K-DGEA, uses a first order Markov model optimized with an Expectation Maximization Algorithm with Kalman Equations. The second, R-DGEA, makes use of a Recurrent Neural Network to model the time dependence. We evaluate our method on several quantitative tasks: author identification, classification, and co-authorship prediction, on two datasets written in English. In addition, our model is language agnostic since it only requires pre-trained document embeddings. It outperforms existing baselines by up to 18% on an author classification task on a news articles dataset.",

We use this dataset to train an accurate classifier for predicting mentorship relations from bibliographic features, achieving a held-out area under the ROC curve of 0.96. Our second dataset is formed by applying the classifier to the complete co-authorship graph of S2. The result is an inferred graph with 137 million weighted mentorship edges among 24 million nodes.

    "abstract": "Creating and curating knowledge resources has been a paramount activity in the biomedical domain. In recent years, automated methods for knowledge base construction have flourished and have enabled large scale construction and curation of such resources. In the biological domain, techniques such as next generation sequencing produce new data at exponential rate, making mere manual curation of knowledge resources simply unfeasible. The major technology to automate knowledge base construction is Information Extraction \u2014 specifically tasks such as Named Entity Recognition or Relation Extraction. The major hurdle for IE methods is the availability of labelled data for training, which can be prohibitively expensive and challenging to obtain due to the need of domain experts. Active learning aims at minimizing the cost of manual labelling by only requiring it for smaller and more useful portions of the data. With this motivation, we devised a method to quickly construct highly curated datasets to enable biomedical knowledge base construction. The method, named BioAct, is based on a partnership between automatic annotation methods (leveraging SciBERT with other machine learning models) and subject matter experts and uses active learning to create training datasets in the biological domain. The main contribution of this work is twofold; in addition to the BioAct method itself, we publicly release an annotated dataset on antimicrobial resistance, produced by a team of subject matter experts using BioAct. Additionally, we simulate a knowledge base construction task using the MegaRes and CARD knowledge bases to provide insight and lessons learned about the usefulness of the annotated dataset for this task.",

Recently, in-domain pretraining has been shown to benefit various domain-specific downstream tasks. In the biomedical domain, natural language generation (NLG) tasks are of critical importance, while understudied. Approaching natural language understanding (NLU) tasks as NLG achieves satisfying performance in the general domain through constrained language generation or language prompting. We emphasize the lack of in-domain generative language models and the unsystematic generative downstream benchmarks in the biomedical domain, hindering the development of the research community. In this work, we introduce the generative language model BioBART that adapts BART to the biomedical domain. We collate various biomedical language generation tasks including dialogue, summarization, entity linking, and named entity recognition. BioBART pretrained on PubMed abstracts has enhanced performance compared to BART and set strong baselines on several tasks. Furthermore, we conduct ablation studies on the pretraining tasks for BioBART and find that sentence permutation has negative effects on downstream tasks.",

    "abstract": "The problem of identifying common concepts in the sciences and deciding when new ideas have emerged is an open one. Metascience researchers have sought to formalize principles underlying stages in the life-cycle of scientific research, determine how knowledge is transferred between scientists and stakeholders, and understand how new ideas are generated and take hold. Here, we model the state of scientific knowledge immediately preceding new directions of research as a metastable state and the creation of new concepts as combinatorial innovation. We find that, through the combined use of natural language clustering and citation graph analysis, we can predict the evolution of ideas over time and thus connect a single scientific article to past and future concepts in a way that goes beyond traditional citation and reference connections.",

    "abstract": "Background: Automating the recognition of outcomes reported in clinical trials using machine learning has a huge potential of speeding up access to evidence necessary in healthcare decision making. Prior research has however acknowledged inadequate training corpora as a challenge for the Outcome detection (OD) task. Additionally, several contextualised representations (embeddings) like BERT and ELMO have achieved unparalleled success in detecting various diseases, genes, proteins and chemicals, however, the same cannot be emphatically stated for outcomes, because these representation models have been relatively undertested and studied for the OD task. Methods: We introduce \u201cEBM-COMET\u201d, a dataset in which 300 Randomised Clinical Trial (RCT) PubMed abstracts are expertly annotated for clinical outcomes. Unlike prior related datasets that use arbitrary outcome classifications, we use labels from a taxonomy recently published to standardise outcome classifications. To extract outcomes, we fine-tune a variety of pre-trained contextualised representations, additionally, we use frozen contextualised and context-independent representations in our custom neural model augmented with clinically informed Part-Of-Speech embeddings and a costsensitive loss function. We adopt strict evaluation for the trained models by rewarding them for correctly identifying full outcome phrases rather than words within the entities i.e. given an outcome phrase \u201csystolic blood pressure\u201d, the models are rewarded a classification score only when they predict all 3 words in sequence, otherwise, they are not rewarded. Results and Conclusion: We observe our best model (BioBERT) achieve 81.5% F1, 81.3% sensitivity and 98.0% specificity. We reach a consensus on which contextualised representations are best suited for detecting outcome phrases from clinical trial abstracts. Furthermore, our best model outperforms scores published on the original EBM-NLP dataset leader-board scores.",

    "abstract": "Academic research is an exploration activity to solve problems that have never been resolved before. By this nature, each academic research work is required to perform a literature review to distinguish its novelties that have not been addressed by prior works. In natural language processing, this literature review is usually conducted under the\"Related Work\"section. The task of automatic related work generation aims to automatically generate the\"Related Work\"section given the rest of the research paper and a list of cited papers. Although this task was proposed over 10 years ago, it received little attention until very recently, when it was cast as a variant of the scientific multi-document summarization problem. However, even today, the problems of automatic related work and citation text generation are not yet standardized. In this survey, we conduct a meta-study to compare the existing literature on related work generation from the perspectives of problem formulation, dataset collection, methodological approach, performance evaluation, and future prospects to provide the reader insight into the progress of the state-of-the-art studies, as well as and how future studies can be conducted. We also survey relevant fields of study that we suggest future work to consider integrating.",

    "abstract": "When an NLP model is trained on text data from one time period and tested or deployed on data from another, the resulting temporal misalignment can degrade end-task performance. In this work, we establish a suite of eight diverse tasks across different domains (social media, science papers, news, and reviews) and periods of time (spanning five years or more) to quantify the effects of temporal misalignment. Our study is focused on the ubiquitous setting where a pretrained model is optionally adapted through continued domain-specific pretraining, followed by task-specific finetuning. We establish a suite of tasks across multiple domains to study temporal misalignment in modern NLP systems. We find stronger effects of temporal misalignment on task performance than have been previously reported. We also find that, while temporal adaptation through continued pretraining can help, these gains are small compared to task-specific finetuning on data from the target time period. Our findings motivate continued research to improve temporal robustness of NLP models.",

    "abstract": "Natural language processing (NLP) systems have become a central technology in communication, education, medicine, artificial intelligence, and many other domains of research and development. While the performance of NLP methods has grown enormously over the last decade, this progress has been restricted to a minuscule subset of the world\u2019s \\approx6,500 languages. We introduce a framework for estimating the global utility of language technologies as revealed in a comprehensive snapshot of recent publications in NLP. Our analyses involve the field at large, but also more in-depth studies on both user-facing technologies (machine translation, language understanding, question answering, text-to-speech synthesis) as well as foundational NLP tasks (dependency parsing, morphological inflection). In the process, we (1) quantify disparities in the current state of NLP research, (2) explore some of its associated societal and academic factors, and (3) produce tailored recommendations for evidence-based policy making aimed at promoting more global and equitable language technologies. Data and code to reproduce the findings discussed in this paper areavailable on GitHub (https://github.com/neubig/globalutility).",

    "abstract": "The NLP pipeline has evolved dramatically in the last few years. The first step in the pipeline is to find suitable annotated datasets to evaluate the tasks we are trying to solve. Unfortunately, most of the published datasets lack metadata annotations that describe their attributes. Not to mention, the absence of a public catalogue that indexes all the publicly available datasets related to specific regions or languages. When we consider low-resource dialectical languages, for example, this issue becomes more prominent. In this paper, we create Masader, the largest public catalogue for Arabic NLP datasets, which consists of 200 datasets annotated with 25 attributes. Furthermore, we develop a metadata annotation strategy that could be extended to other languages. We also make remarks and highlight some issues about the current status of Arabic NLP datasets and suggest recommendations to address them.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning currently exerts an outsized influence on the world, increasingly affecting institutional practices and impacted communities. It is therefore critical that we question vague conceptions of the field as value-neutral or universally beneficial, and investigate what specific values the field is advancing. In this paper, we first introduce a method and annotation scheme for studying the values encoded in documents such as research papers. Applying the scheme, we analyze 100 highly cited machine learning papers published at premier machine learning conferences, ICML and NeurIPS. We annotate key features of papers which reveal their values: their justification for their choice of project, which attributes of their project they uplift, their consideration of potential negative consequences, and their institutional affiliations and funding sources. We find that few of the papers justify how their project connects to a societal need (15%) and far fewer discuss negative potential (1%). Through line-by-line content analysis, we identify 59 values that are uplifted in ML research, and, of these, we find that the papers most frequently justify and assess themselves based on Performance, Generalization, Quantitative evidence, Efficiency, Building on past work, and Novelty. We present extensive textual evidence and identify key themes in the definitions and operationalization of these values. Notably, we find systematic textual evidence that these top values are being defined and applied with assumptions and implications generally supporting the centralization of power. Finally, we find increasingly close ties between these highly cited papers and tech companies and elite universities.",

    "abstract": "Accurately extracting structured content from PDFs is a critical first step for NLP over scientific papers. Recent work has improved extraction accuracy by incorporating elementary layout information, for example, each token\u2019s 2D position on the page, into language model pretraining. We introduce new methods that explicitly model VIsual LAyout (VILA) groups, that is, text lines or text blocks, to further improve performance. In our I-VILA approach, we show that simply inserting special tokens denoting layout group boundaries into model inputs can lead to a 1.9% Macro F1 improvement in token classification. In the H-VILA approach, we show that hierarchical encoding of layout-groups can result in up to 47% inference time reduction with less than 0.8% Macro F1 loss. Unlike prior layout-aware approaches, our methods do not require expensive additional pretraining, only fine-tuning, which we show can reduce training cost by up to 95%. Experiments are conducted on a newly curated evaluation suite, S2-VLUE, that unifies existing automatically labeled datasets and includes a new dataset of manual annotations covering diverse papers from 19 scientific disciplines. Pre-trained weights, benchmark datasets, and source code are available at https://github.com/allenai/VILA.",

    "abstract": "Academic Knowledge Services have substantially facilitated the development of human science and technology, providing a plenitude of useful research tools. However, many applications highly depend on ad-hoc models and expensive human labeling to understand professional contents, hindering deployments in real world. To create a unified backbone language model for various knowledge-intensive academic knowledge mining challenges, based on the world's largest public academic graph Open Academic Graph (OAG), we pre-train an academic language model, namely OAG-BERT, to integrate massive heterogeneous entity knowledge beyond scientific corpora. We develop novel pre-training strategies along with zero-shot inference techniques. OAG-BERT's superior performance on 9 knowledge-intensive academic tasks (including 2 demo applications) demonstrates its qualification to serve as a foundation for academic knowledge services. Its zero-shot capability also offers great potential to mitigate the need of costly annotations. OAG-BERT has been deployed to multiple real-world applications, such as reviewer recommendations for NSFC (National Nature Science Foundation of China) and paper tagging in the AMiner system. All codes and pre-trained models are available via the CogDL.",

    "abstract": "Citation count prediction is the task of predicting the number of citations a paper has gained after a period of time. Prior work viewed this as a static prediction task. As papers and their citations evolve over time, considering the dynamics of the number of citations a paper will receive would seem logical. Here, we introduce the task of sequence citation prediction, where the goal is to accurately predict the trajectory of the number of citations a scholarly work receives over time. We propose to view papers as a structured network of citations, allowing us to use topological information as a learning signal. Additionally, we learn how this dynamic citation network changes over time and the impact of paper meta-data such as authors, venues and abstracts. To approach the introduced task, we derive a dynamic citation network from Semantic Scholar which spans over 42 years. We present a model which exploits topological and temporal information using graph convolution networks paired with sequence prediction, and compare it against multiple baselines, testing the importance of topological and temporal information and analyzing model performance. Our experiments show that leveraging both the temporal and topological information greatly increases the performance of predicting citation counts over time.",

Essential tasks such as information retrieval and research networking have turned into extremely difficult operations due to an ever-growing number of researchers and scientific articles. Numerous initiatives have emerged in the IT environments to address this issue, especially focused on web technologies. Although those approaches have individually provided solutions for diverse problems, they still can not offer integrated knowledge bases nor flexibility to exploit adequately this information. In this article, we present REDI, a Linked Data-powered framework for academic knowledge management and research networking, which introduces a new perspective of integration. REDI combines information from multiple sources into a consolidated knowledge base through state-of-the-art procedures and leverages semantic web standards to represent the information. Moreover, REDI takes advantage of such knowledge for data visualisation and analysis, which ultimately improves and simplifies many activities including research networking.",

Training models to extract scientific information from the full texts of scholarly documents is important for improving how we structure and access scientific information.

This paper presents the NLPSharedTasks corpus, a new resource of 254 full text Shared Task Overview papers in NLP domains with annotated task descriptions. We calculated strict and relaxed inter-annotator agreement scores, achieving Cohen\u2019s kappa coefficients of 0.44 and 0.95, respectively. Lastly, we performed a sentence classification task over the dataset, in order to generate a neural baseline for future research and to provide an example of how to preprocess unbalanced datasets of full scientific texts. We achieved an F1 score of 0.75 using SciBERT, fine-tuned and tested on a rebalanced version of the dataset.",

The objective of the shared task was to label given research papers with research themes from a total of 36 themes. The benchmark was compiled using data drawn from the largest overall assessment of university research output ever undertaken globally (the Research Excellence Framework - 2014). We provide a performance comparison of a transformer-based ensemble, which obtains multiple predictions for a research paper, given its multiple textual fields (e.g. title, abstract, reference), with traditional machine learning models. The ensemble involves enriching the initial data with additional information from open-access digital libraries and Argumentative Zoning techniques (CITATION). It uses a weighted sum aggregation for the multiple predictions to obtain a final single prediction for the given research paper. Both data and the ensemble are publicly available on https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/sdp2022-scholarly-knowledge-graph-generation/data?select=task1_test_no_label.csv and https://github.com/ProjectDoSSIER/sdp2022, respectively.",

    "abstract": "The paper aims to identify cited text spans in the reference paper related to the given citance in the citing paper. We refer to it as cited text span retrieval (CTSR). Most current methods attempt this task by relying on pre-trained off-the-shelf deep learning models like SciBERT. Though these models are pre-trained on large datasets, they under-perform in out-of-domain settings. We introduce CitRet, a novel hybrid model for CTSR that leverages unique semantic and syntactic structural characteristics of scientific documents. This enables us to use significantly less data for finetuning. We use only 1040 documents for finetuning. Our model augments mildly-trained SBERT-based contextual embeddings with pre-trained non-contextual Word2Vec embeddings to calculate semantic textual similarity. We demonstrate the performance of our model on the CLSciSumm shared tasks. It improves the state-of-the-art results by over 15% on the F1 score evaluation.",

To help advance research in political science, we introduce ConfliBERT, a domain-specific pre-trained language model for conflict and political violence. We first gather a large domain-specific text corpus for language modeling from various sources. We then build ConfliBERT using two approaches: pre-training from scratch and continual pre-training. To evaluate ConfliBERT, we collect 12 datasets and implement 18 tasks to assess the models\u2019 practical application in conflict research.

In this paper we examine the problem of detecting GPT-2-generated technical research text. We first consider the realistic scenario where the defender does not have full information about the adversary\u2019s text generation pipeline, but is able to label small amounts of in-domain genuine and synthetic text in order to adapt to the target distribution. Even in the extreme scenario of adapting a physics-domain detector to a biomedical detector, we find that only a few hundred labels are sufficient for good performance.

Using Scim as a design probe, we explore the benefits and drawbacks of imperfect AI assistance within an augmented reading interface. We found researchers used Scim in several different ways: from reading primarily in the \u2018highlight browser\u2019 (side panel) to making multiple passes through the paper with different facets activated (e.g., focusing solely on objective and novelty in their first pass). From our study, we identify six key design recommendations and avenues for future research in augmented reading interfaces.",

    "abstract": "Objective The accelerating pace of biomedical publication has made retrieving papers and extracting specific comprehensive scientific information a key challenge. A timely example of such a challenge is to retrieve the subset of papers that report on immune signatures (coherent sets of biomarkers) to understand the immune response mechanisms which drive differential SARS-CoV-2 infection outcomes. A systematic and scalable approach is needed to identify and extract COVID-19 immune signatures in a structured and machine-readable format. Materials and Methods We used SPECTER embeddings with SVM classifiers to automatically identify papers containing immune signatures. A generic web platform was used to manually screen papers and allow anonymous submission. Results We demonstrate a classifier that retrieves papers with human COVID-19 immune signatures with a positive predictive value of 86%. Semi-automated queries to the corresponding authors of these publications requesting signature information achieved a 31% response rate. This demonstrates the efficacy of using a SVM classifier with document embeddings of the abstract and title, to retrieve papers with scientifically salient information, even when that information is rarely present in the abstract. Additionally, classification based on the embeddings identified the type of immune signature (e.g., gene expression vs. other types of profiling) with a positive predictive value of 74%. Conclusion Coupling a classifier based on document embeddings with direct author engagement offers a promising pathway to build a semistructured representation of scientifically relevant information. Through this approach, partially automated literature mining can help rapidly create semistructured knowledge repositories for automatic analysis of emerging health threats.",

However, much of the design and specifications of an accessible, usable, scalable, and sustainable DLSE have not been well represented and discussed in the literature. We argue that these four characteristics are essential to providing a high-quality service for scholarly big data from both the user and developer\u2019s perspectives. This paper reviews the design, implementation, and operation experiences, and lessons of CiteSeerX, a real-world digital library search engine. We analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the current design, and proposed a new design with a revised architecture, enhanced hardware, and software infrastructure. The Alpha version of the new design has been implemented and tested. The new system replaces MySQL and Apache Solr with a single instance of Elasticsearch, which plays a dual role of data storage and search. Another major improvement is the integration of extraction and ingestion, which significantly boosts document ingestion speed. The web application is re-engineered to enhance the user experience by applying a learning-to-rank model and offering more refined search tools. The system is also improved in many other aspects. We believe the design considerations and experience can benefit researchers and engineers who plan, design, and upgrade future systems with comparable scales and functionalities.",

    "title": "Performance Optimization for Semantic Communications: An Attention-based Learning Approach",
    "abstract": "In this paper, a semantic communication framework is proposed for wireless networks. In the proposed framework, a base station (BS) extracts the semantic information from textual data, and, transmits it to each user. This semantic information is modeled by a knowledge graph (KG) and hence, the semantic information consists of a set of semantic triples. After receiving the semantic information, each user recovers the original text using a graph-to-text generation model. To measure the performance of the studied semantic communication system, a metric of semantic similarity (MSS) that jointly captures the semantic accuracy and completeness of the recovered text is proposed. Due to wireless resource limitations, the BS can only transmit partial semantic information to each user so as to satisfy the transmission delay constraint. Hence, the BS must select an appropriate resource block for each user and determine partial semantic information to be transmitted. This problem is formulated as an optimization problem whose goal is to maximize the total MSS by optimizing the resource allocation policy and determining the partial semantic information to be transmitted. To solve this problem, a policy gradient-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm integrated with the attention network is proposed. The proposed algorithm can evaluate the importance of each triple in the semantic information using an attention network and then, build a relationship between the importance distribution of the triples in the semantic information and the total MSS. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed semantic communication framework can reduce the size of data that the BS needs to transmit by up to 46% and yield a two-fold improvement in the total MSS compared to a standard communication network that does not consider semantic communications.",

    "title": "CoBERT: Scientific Collaboration Prediction via Sequential Recommendation",
    "abstract": "Collaborations are an Important factor for scientific success, as the joint work leads to results individual scientists cannot easily reach. Recommending collaborations automatically can alleviate the time consuming and tedious search for potential collaborators. Usually, such recommendation systems rely on graph structures modeling co-authorship of papers and content-based relations such as similar paper keywords. Models are then trained to estimate the probability of links between certain authors in these graphs.In this paper, we argue that the order of papers is crucial for reliably predicting future collaborations, which is not considered by graph-based recommendation systems. We thus propose to reformulate the task of collaboration recommendation as a sequential recommendation task. Here, we aim to predict the next co-author in a chronologically sorted sequence of an author\u2019s collaborators. We introduce CoBERT, a BERT4Rec inspired model, that predicts the sequence\u2019s next co-author and thus a potential collaborator. Since the order of co-authors of a single paper is not that important compared to the overall paper order, we leverage positional embeddings encoding paper positions instead of co-author positions in the sequence. Additionally, we inject content features about every paper and their co-authors. We evaluate CoBERT on two datasets consisting of papers from the field of Artificial Intelligence and the journal PlosOne. We show that CoBERT can outperform graph-based methods and BERT4Rec when predicting the co-authors of the next paper. We make our code and data available.",

In this paper, we introduce the Academia/Industry DynAmics (AIDA) Knowledge Graph, which describes 21 million publications and 8 million patents according to the research topics drawn from the Computer Science Ontology. 5.1 million publications and 5.6 million patents are further characterized according to the type of the author\u2019s affiliations and 66 industrial sectors from the proposed Industrial Sectors Ontology (INDUSO). AIDA was generated by an automatic pipeline that integrates data from Microsoft Academic Graph, Dimensions, DBpedia, the Computer Science Ontology, and the Global Research Identifier Database. It is publicly available under CC BY 4.0 and can be downloaded as a dump or queried via a triplestore. We evaluated the different parts of the generation pipeline on a manually crafted gold standard yielding competitive results.",

In digital pathology, high-resolution images of tissue samples are stored along with pathology reports. Despite the valuable information that pathology reports hold, they are not used in any systematic manner to promote computational pathology. In this work, we focus on analyzing the reports, which are generally unstructured documents written in English with sophisticated and highly specialized medical terminology. We provide a comparative analysis of various embedding models like BioBERT, Clinical BioBERT, BioMed-RoBERTa and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), a traditional NLP technique, as well as the combination of embeddings from pre-trained models with TF-IDF. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of various word embedding techniques for pathology reports.",

    "abstract": "The investigation of social networks is often hindered by their size as such networks often consist of at least thousands of vertices and edges. Hence, it is of major interest to derive compact structures that represent important connections of the original network. In this work, we derive such structures with orometric methods that are originally designed to identify outstanding mountain peaks and relationships between them. By adapting these methods to social networks, it is possible to derive family trees of important vertices. Our approach consists of two steps. We first apply a novel method for discarding edges that stand for weak connections. This is done such that the connectivity of the network is preserved. Then, we identify the important \u201cpeaks\u201d in the network and the \u201ckey cols\u201d, i.e., the lower points that connect them. This gives us a compact network that displays which peaks are connected through which cols. Thus, a natural hierarchy on the peaks arises by the question which higher peak comes behind the col, yielding to chains of peaks with increasing heights. The resulting \u201cline parent hierarchy\u201d displays dominance relations between important vertices. We show that networks with hundreds or thousands of edges can be condensed to a small set of vertices and key connections and that our approach scales to networks with millions of nodes.",

    "abstract": "The literature on coronaviruses counts more than 300,000 publications. Finding relevant papers concerning arbitrary queries is essential to discovery helpful knowledge. Current best information retrieval (IR) use deep learning approaches and need supervised training sets with labeled data, namely to know a priori the queries and their corresponding relevant papers. Creating such labeled datasets is time-expensive and requires prominent experts\u2019 efforts, resources insufficiently available under a pandemic time pressure. We present a new self-supervised solution, called SUBLIMER, that does not require labels to learn to search on corpora of scientific papers for most relevant against arbitrary queries. SUBLIMER is a novel efficient IR engine trained on the unsupervised COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD19), using deep metric learning. The core point of our self-supervised approach is that it uses no labels, but exploits the bibliography citations from papers to create a latent space where their spatial proximity is a metric of semantic similarity; for this reason, it can also be applied to other domains of papers corpora. SUBLIMER, despite is self-supervised, outperforms the Precision@5 (P@5) and Bpref of the state-of-the-art competitors on CORD19, which, differently from our approach, require both labeled datasets and a number of trainable parameters that is an order of magnitude higher than our.",

Important aspects to consider are the suitability of research topics, a venue\u2019s prestige, and the probability of acceptance. The selection problem is exacerbated through the continuous emergence of additional venues. Previously proposed approaches for supporting authors in this process rely on complex recommender systems, e.g., based on Word2Vec or TextCNN. These, however, often elude an explanation for their recommendations. In this work, we propose an unsophisticated method that advances the state-of-the-art in two aspects: First, we enhance the interpretability of recommendations through non-negative matrix factorization based topic models; Second, we surprisingly can obtain competitive recommendation performance while using simpler learning methods.",

    "abstract": "Background Drug-target interactions (DTIs) are critical for drug repurposing and elucidation of drug mechanisms, and are manually curated by large databases, such as ChEMBL, BindingDB, DrugBank and DrugTargetCommons. However, the number of curated articles likely constitutes only a fraction of all the articles that contain experimentally determined DTIs. Finding such articles and extracting the experimental information is a challenging task, and there is a pressing need for systematic approaches to assist the curation of DTIs. To this end, we applied Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) to identify such articles. Because DTI data intimately depends on the type of assays used to generate it, we also aimed to incorporate functions to predict the assay format. Results Our novel method identified 0.6 million articles (along with drug and protein information) which are not previously included in public DTI databases. Using 10-fold cross-validation, we obtained\u2009~\u200999% accuracy for identifying articles containing quantitative drug-target profiles. The F1 micro for the prediction of assay format is 88%, which leaves room for improvement in future studies. Conclusion The BERT model in this study is robust and the proposed pipeline can be used to identify previously overlooked articles containing quantitative DTIs. Overall, our method provides a significant advancement in machine-assisted DTI extraction and curation. We expect it to be a useful addition to drug mechanism discovery and repurposing.",

    "abstract": "In applied multivariate statistics, estimating the number of latent dimensions or the number of clusters is a fundamental and recurring problem. One common diagnostic is the scree plot, which shows the largest eigenvalues of the data matrix in decreasing order; the user searches for a \u201cgap\u201d or \u201celbow\u201d in the decaying eigenvalues; unfortunately, these patterns can hide beneath the bias of the sample eigenvalues. This methodological problem is conceptually difficult because, in many situations, there is only enough signal to detect a subset of the k population dimensions/eigenvectors. In this situation, one could argue that the correct choice of k is the number of detectable dimensions. We alleviate these problems with cross-validated eigenvalues. Under a large class of random graph models, without any parametric assumptions, we provide a p-value for each sample eigenvector. It tests the null hypothesis that this sample eigenvector is orthogonal to (i.e., uncorrelated with) the true latent dimensions. This approach naturally adapts to problems where some dimensions are not statistically detectable.

    "abstract": "A deep understanding about a field of research is valuable for academic researchers. In addition to technical knowledge, this includes knowledge about subareas, open research questions, and social communities (networks) of individuals and organizations within a given field. With bibliometric analyses, researchers can acquire quantitatively valuable knowledge about a research area by using bibliographic information on academic publications provided by bibliographic data providers. Bibliometric analyses include the calculation of bibliometric networks to describe affiliations or similarities of bibliometric entities (e.g., authors) and group them into clusters representing subareas or communities. Calculating and visualizing bibliometric networks is a nontrivial and time-consuming data science task that requires highly skilled individuals. In addition to domain knowledge, researchers must often provide statistical knowledge and programming skills or use software tools having limited functionality and usability. In this paper, we present the ambalytics bibliometric platform, which reduces the complexity of bibliometric network analysis and the visualization of results. It accompanies users through the process of bibliometric analysis and eliminates the need for individuals to have programming skills and statistical knowledge, while preserving advanced functionality, such as algorithm parameterization, for experts. As a proof-of-concept, and as an example of bibliometric analyses outcomes, the calculation of research fronts networks based on a hybrid similarity approach is shown. Being designed to scale, ambalytics makes use of distributed systems concepts and technologies. It is based on the microservice architecture concept and uses the Kubernetes framework for orchestration. This paper presents the initial building block of a comprehensive bibliometric analysis platform called ambalytics, which aims at a high usability for users as well as scalability.",

    "abstract": "Profiting from the pre-trained language representation models like BERT, the recently proposed document classification methods have obtained considerable improvement. However, most of these methods usually model the document as a sequence of text and omit the structure information, which appears obviously in long document composed of several sections with assigned relations. For this purpose, we propose a novel Hierarchical Attention Transformer Network (HATN) for long document classification, which extracts the structure of the long document by intra- and inter-section attention transformers, and further strengths the feature interaction by two fusion gates: the Residual Fusion Gate (RFG) and the Feature Fusion Gate (FFG). The proposed method is evaluated on three long document datasets and the experimental results show that our approach outperforms the related state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "An obstacle to scientific document understanding is the extensive use of acronyms which are shortened forms of long technical phrases. Acronym disambiguation aims to find the correct meaning of an ambiguous acronym in a given text. Recent efforts attempted to incorporate word embeddings and deep learning architectures, and achieved significant effects in this task. In general domains, kinds of fine-grained pretrained language models have sprung up, thanks to the largescale corpora which can usually be obtained through crowdsourcing. However, these models based on domain agnostic knowledge might achieve insufficient performance when directly applied to the scientific domain. Moreover, obtaining large-scale high-quality annotated data and representing high-level semantics in the scientific domain is challenging and expensive. In this paper, we consider both the domain agnostic and specific knowledge, and propose a Hierarchical Dual-path BERT method coined hdBERT to capture the general fine-grained and high-level specific representations for acronym disambiguation. First, the context-based pretrained models, RoBERTa and SciBERT, are elaborately involved in encoding these two kinds of knowledge respectively. Second, multiple layer perceptron is devised to integrate the dualpath representations simultaneously and outputs the prediction. With a widely adopted SciAD dataset contained 62,441 sentences, we investigate the effectiveness of hdBERT. The experimental results exhibit that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods among various evaluation metrics. Specifically, its macro F1 achieves 93.73%.",

    "abstract": "Domain-specific contextualized languagemodels have demonstrated substantial effectiveness gains for domain-specific downstream tasks, like similarity matching, entity recognition or information retrieval. However successfully applying such models in highly specific language domains requires domain adaptation of the pretrained models. In this paper we propose the empirically motivated Linguistically Informed Masking (LIM) method to focus domainadaptative pre-training on the linguistic patterns of patents, which use a highly technical sublanguage. We quantify the relevant differences between patent, scientific and general-purpose language and demonstrate for two different language models (BERT and SciBERT) that domain adaptation with LIM leads to systematically improved representations by evaluating the performance of the domain-adapted representations of patent language on two independent downstream tasks, the IPC classification and similarity matching. We demonstrate the impact of balancing the learning from different information sources during domain adaptation for the patent domain. We make the source code as well as the domainadaptive pre-trained patent language models publicly available at https://github.com/sophiaalthammer/patent-lim.",

Graphsurge is designed to support applications that analyze multiple snapshots or views of a large-scale graph. Users program Graphsurge through a declarative graph view definition language (GVDL) to create views over input graphs and a Differential Dataflow-based programming API to write analytics computations. A key feature of GVDL is the ability to organize views into view collections, which allowsGraphsurge to automatically share computation across views, without users writing any incrementalization code, by performing computations differentially. We then introduce two optimization problems that naturally arise in our setting. First is the collection ordering problem to determine the order of views that leads to minimum differences across consecutive views. We prove this problem is NP-hard and show a constant-factor approximation algorithm drawn from literature. Second is the collection splitting problem to decide on which views to run computations differentially vs from scratch, for which we present an adaptive solution that makes decisions at runtime. We present extensive experiments to demonstrate the benefits of running computations differentially for view collections and our collection ordering and splitting optimizations.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 is having a dramatic impact on research and researchers. The pandemic has underlined the severity of known challenges in research and surfaced new ones, but also accelerated the adoption of innovations and manifested new opportunities. This review considers early trends emerging from meta-research on COVID-19. In particular, it focuses on the following topics: i) mapping COVID-19 research;ii) data and machine learning;iii) research practices including open access and open data, reviewing, publishing and funding;iv) communicating research to the public;v) the impact of COVID-19 on researchers, in particular with respect to gender and career trajectories. This overview finds that most early meta-research on COVID-19 has been reactive and focused on short-term questions, while more recently a shift to consider the long-term consequences of COVID-19 is taking place. Based on these findings, the author speculates that some aspects of doing research during COVID-19 are more likely to persist than others. These include: the shift to virtual for academic events such as conferences;the use of openly accessible pre-prints;the `datafication' of scholarly literature and consequent broader adoption of machine learning in science communication;the public visibility of research and researchers on social and online media.",

There are two core challenges, which should be addressed: 1) ensuring that scientific publications are credible \u2013 e.g. that claims are not made without supporting evidence, and that all relevant supporting evidence is provided; and 2) that scientific findings are not misrepresented, distorted or outright misreported when communicated by journalists or the general public. I will present some first steps towards addressing these problems and outline remaining challenges.",

    "abstract": "The success of research institutions heavily relies upon identifying the right researchers\"for the job\": researchers may need to identify appropriate collaborators, often from across disciplines; students may need to identify suitable supervisors for projects of their interest; administrators may need to match funding opportunities with relevant researchers, and so on. Usually, finding potential collaborators in institutions is a time-consuming manual search task prone to bias. In this paper, we propose a novel query-based framework for searching, scoring, and exploring research expertise automatically, based upon processing abstracts of academic publications. Given user queries in natural language, our framework finds researchers with relevant expertise, making use of domain-specific knowledge bases and word embeddings. It also generates explanations for its recommendations. We evaluate our framework with an institutional repository of papers from a leading university, using, as baselines, artificial neural networks and transformer-based models for a multilabel classification task to identify authors of publication abstracts. We also assess the cross-domain effectiveness of our framework with a (separate) research funding repository for the same institution. We show that our simple method is effective in identifying matches, while satisfying desirable properties and being efficient.",

    "abstract": "Scientific document understanding is challenging as the data is highly domain specific and diverse. However, datasets for tasks with scientific text require expensive manual annotation and tend to be small and limited to only one or a few fields. At the same time, scientific documents contain many potential training signals, such as citations, which can be used to build large labelled datasets. Given this, we present an in-depth study of cite-worthiness detection in English, where a sentence is labelled for whether or not it cites an external source. To accomplish this, we introduce CiteWorth, a large, contextualized, rigorously cleaned labelled dataset for cite-worthiness detection built from a massive corpus of extracted plain-text scientific documents. We show that CiteWorth is high-quality, challenging, and suitable for studying problems such as domain adaptation. Our best performing cite-worthiness detection model is a paragraph-level contextualized sentence labelling model based on Longformer, exhibiting a 5 F1 point improvement over SciBERT which considers only individual sentences. Finally, we demonstrate that language model fine-tuning with cite-worthiness as a secondary task leads to improved performance on downstream scientific document understanding tasks.",

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its relation with societies has become an increasingly interesting subject of study for the social sciences. Nevertheless, there is still an important lack of interdisciplinary and empirical research applying social theories to the field of AI. We here aim to shed light on the interactions between humans and autonomous systems and analyse the moral conventions, which underly these interactions and cause moments of conflict and cooperation. For this purpose we employ the Economics of Convention (EC), originally developed in the context of economic processes of production and management involving humans, objects and machines. We create a dataset from three relevant text sources and perform a qualitative exploration of its content. Then, we train a combination of Machine Learning (ML) classifiers on this dataset, which achieve an average classification accuracy of 83.7%. A qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the predicted conventions reveals, inter alia, that the Industrial and Inspired conventions tend to co-exist in the AI domain. \n This is the first time, ML classifiers are used to study the EC in different AI-related text types. Our analysis of a larger dataset is especially beneficial for the social sciences.",

    "abstract": "Researchers are often evaluated by citation-based metrics. Such metrics can inform hiring, promotion, and funding decisions. Concerns have been expressed that popular citation-based metrics incentivize researchers to maximize the production of publications. Such incentives may not be optimal for scientific progress. Here we present a citation-based measure that rewards both productivity and taste: the researcher's ability to focus on impactful contributions. The presented measure, CAP, balances the impact of publications and their quantity, thus incentivizing researchers to consider whether a publication is a useful addition to the literature. CAP is simple, interpretable, and parameter-free. We analyze the characteristics of CAP for highly-cited researchers in biology, computer science, economics, and physics, using a corpus of millions of publications and hundreds of millions of citations with yearly temporal granularity. CAP produces qualitatively plausible outcomes and has a number of advantages over prior metrics. Results can be explored at this https URL",

With our novel graph self-attention, the encoding of a node relies on all nodes in the input graph - not only direct neighbors - facilitating the detection of global patterns. We represent the relation between two nodes as the length of the shortest path between them. Graformer learns to weight these node-node relations differently for different attention heads, thus virtually learning differently connected views of the input graph. We evaluate Graformer on two popular graph-to-text generation benchmarks, AGENDA and WebNLG, where it achieves strong performance while using many fewer parameters than other approaches.",

    "abstract": "Despite peer-reviewing being an essential component of academia since the 1600s, it has repeatedly received criticisms for lack of transparency and consistency. We posit that recent work in machine learning and explainable AI provide tools that enable insights into the decisions from a given peer-review process. We start by simulating the peer-review process using an ML classifier and extracting global explanations in the form of linguistic features that affect the acceptance of a scientific paper for publication on an open peer-review dataset. Second, since such global explanations do not justify causal interpretations, we propose a methodology for detecting confounding effects in natural language and generating explanations, disentangled from textual confounders, in the form of lexicons. Our proposed linguistic explanation methodology indicates the following on a case dataset of ICLR submissions: a) the organising committee follows, for the most part, the recommendations of reviewers, and b) the paper\u2019s main characteristics that led to reviewers recommending acceptance for publication are originality, clarity and substance.",

    "abstract": "The number of scholarly publications grows steadily every year and it becomes harder to find, assess and compare scholarly knowledge effectively. Scholarly knowledge graphs have the potential to address these challenges. However, creating such graphs remains a complex task. We propose a method to crowdsource structured scholarly knowledge from paper authors with a web-based user interface supported by artificial intelligence. The interface enables authors to select key sentences for annotation. It integrates multiple machine learning algorithms to assist authors during the annotation, including class recommendation and key sentence highlighting. We envision that the interface is integrated in paper submission processes for which we define three main task requirements: The task has to be . We evaluated the interface with a user study in which participants were assigned the task to annotate one of their own articles. With the resulting data, we determined whether the participants were successfully able to perform the task. Furthermore, we evaluated the interface\u2019s usability and the participant\u2019s attitude towards the interface with a survey. The results suggest that sentence annotation is a feasible task for researchers and that they do not object to annotate their articles during the submission process.",

NLP systems can help to automate or assist in parts of this expensive process. In support of this goal, we release MS\u02c62 (Multi-Document Summarization of Medical Studies), a dataset of over 470k documents and 20K summaries derived from the scientific literature. This dataset facilitates the development of systems that can assess and aggregate contradictory evidence across multiple studies, and is the first large-scale, publicly available multi-document summarization dataset in the biomedical domain. We experiment with a summarization system based on BART, with promising early results, though significant work remains to achieve higher summarization quality. We formulate our summarization inputs and targets in both free text and structured forms and modify a recently proposed metric to assess the quality of our system\u2019s generated summaries.

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of learning to simplify medical texts. This is important because most reliable, up-to-date information in biomedicine is dense with jargon and thus practically inaccessible to the lay audience. Furthermore, manual simplification does not scale to the rapidly growing body of biomedical literature, motivating the need for automated approaches. Unfortunately, there are no large-scale resources available for this task. In this work we introduce a new corpus of parallel texts in English comprising technical and lay summaries of all published evidence pertaining to different clinical topics. We then propose a new metric based on likelihood scores from a masked language model pretrained on scientific texts. We show that this automated measure better differentiates between technical and lay summaries than existing heuristics. We introduce and evaluate baseline encoder-decoder Transformer models for simplification and propose a novel augmentation to these in which we explicitly penalize the decoder for producing \u201cjargon\u201d terms; we find that this yields improvements over baselines in terms of readability.",

    "abstract": "Relational knowledge bases (KBs) are commonly used to represent world knowledge in machines. However, while advantageous for their high degree of precision and interpretability, KBs are usually organized according to manually-defined schemas, which limit their expressiveness and require significant human efforts to engineer and maintain. In this review, we take a natural language processing perspective to these limitations, examining how they may be addressed in part by training deep contextual language models (LMs) to internalize and express relational knowledge in more flexible forms. We propose to organize knowledge representation strategies in LMs by the level of KB supervision provided, from no KB supervision at all to entity- and relation-level supervision. Our contributions are threefold: (1) We provide a high-level, extensible taxonomy for knowledge representation in LMs; (2) Within our taxonomy, we highlight notable models, evaluation tasks, and findings, in order to provide an up-to-date review of current knowledge representation capabilities in LMs; and (3) We suggest future research directions that build upon the complementary aspects of LMs and KBs as knowledge representations.",

    "title": "Accelerating science with human versus alien artificial intelligences",
    "abstract": "Data-driven artificial intelligence models fed with published scientific findings have been used to create powerful prediction engines for scientific and technological advance, such as the discovery of novel materials with desired properties and the targeted invention of new therapies and vaccines. These AI approaches typically ignore the distribution of human prediction engines -- scientists and inventor -- who continuously alter the landscape of discovery and invention. As a result, AI hypotheses are designed to substitute for human experts, failing to complement them for punctuated collective advance. Here we show that incorporating the distribution of human expertise into self-supervised models by training on inferences cognitively available to experts dramatically improves AI prediction of future human discoveries and inventions. Including expert-awareness into models that propose (a) valuable energy-relevant materials increases the precision of materials predictions by ~100%, (b) repurposing thousands of drugs to treat new diseases increases precision by 43%, and (c) COVID-19 vaccine candidates examined in clinical trials by 260%. These models succeed by predicting human predictions and the scientists who will make them. By tuning AI to avoid the crowd, however, it generates scientifically promising \"alien\" hypotheses unlikely to be imagined or pursued without intervention, not only accelerating but punctuating scientific advance. By identifying and correcting for collective human bias, these models also suggest opportunities to improve human prediction by reformulating science education for discovery.",

    "abstract": "The core challenge of steganography is always how to improve the hidden capacity and the concealment. Most current generation-based linguistic steganography methods only consider the probability distribution between text characters, and the emotion and topic of the generated steganographic text are uncontrollable. Especially for long texts, generating several sentences related to a topic and displaying overall coherence and discourse-relatedness can ensure better concealment. In this article, we address the problem of generating coherent multi-sentence texts for better concealment, and a topic-aware neural linguistic steganography method that can generate a steganographic paragraph with a specific topic is present. We achieve a topic-controllable steganographic long text generation by encoding the related entities and their relationships from Knowledge Graphs. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed method can guarantee both the quality of the generated steganographic text and its relevance to a specific topic. The proposed model can be widely used in covert communication, privacy protection, and many other areas of information security.",

To characterize the influences and extensions of accessibility research, we undertake a study of citation trends for accessibility and related HCI communities. We assess the diversity of venues and fields of study represented among the referenced and citing papers of 836 accessibility research papers from ASSETS and CHI, finding that though publications in computer science dominate these citation relationships, the relative proportion of citations from papers on psychology and medicine has grown over time. Though ASSETS is a more niche venue than CHI in terms of citational diversity, both conferences display standard levels of diversity among their incoming and outgoing citations when analyzed in the context of 53K papers from 13 accessibility and HCI conference venues.",

    "abstract": "To enrich language models with domain knowledge is crucial but difficult. Based on the world\u2019s largest public academic graph Open Academic Graph (OAG), we pre-train an academic language model, namely OAG-BERT, which integrates massive heterogeneous entities including paper, author, concept, venue, and affiliation. To better endow OAG-BERT with the ability to capture entity information, we develop novel pre-training strategies including heterogeneous entity type embedding, entity-aware 2D positional encoding, and span-aware entity masking. For zero-shot inference, we design a special decoding strategy to allow OAG-BERT to generate entity names from scratch. We evaluate the OAG-BERT on various downstream academic tasks, including NLP benchmarks, zero-shot entity inference, heterogeneous graph link prediction and author name disambiguation. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed pre-training approach to both comprehending academic texts and modeling knowledge from heterogeneous entities. OAG-BERT has been deployed to multiple real-world applications, such as reviewer recommendations and paper tagging in the AMiner system. OAG-BERT 1 is also available to the public through the CogDL package.",

    "abstract": "Biomedical question-answering (QA) has gained increased attention for its capability to provide users with high-quality information from a vast scientific literature. Although an increasing number of biomedical QA datasets has been recently made available, those resources are still rather limited and expensive to produce; thus, transfer learning via pre-trained language models (LMs) has been shown as a promising approach to leverage existing general-purpose knowledge. However, fine-tuning these large models can be costly and time consuming and often yields limited benefits when adapting to specific themes of specialised domains, such as the COVID-19 literature. Therefore, to bootstrap further their domain adaptation, we propose a simple yet unexplored approach, which we call biomedical entity-aware masking (BEM) strategy, encouraging masked language models to learn entity-centric knowledge based on the pivotal entities characterizing the domain at hand, and employ those entities to drive the LM fine-tuning. The resulting strategy is a downstream process applicable to a wide variety of masked LMs, not requiring additional memory or components in the neural architectures. Experimental results show performance on par with the state-of-the-art models on several biomedical QA datasets.",

    "title": "Making Paper Reviewing Robust to Bid Manipulation Attacks",
    "abstract": "Most computer science conferences rely on paper bidding to assign reviewers to papers. Although paper bidding enables high-quality assignments in days of unprecedented submission numbers, it also opens the door for dishonest reviewers to adversarially influence paper reviewing assignments. Anecdotal evidence suggests that some reviewers bid on papers by \u201cfriends\u201d or colluding authors, even though these papers are outside their area of expertise, and recommend them for acceptance without considering the merit of the work. In this paper, we study the efficacy of such bid manipulation attacks and find that, indeed, they can jeopardize the integrity of the review process. We develop a novel approach for paper bidding and assignment that is much more robust against such attacks. We show empirically that our approach provides robustness even when dishonest reviewers collude, have full knowledge of the assignment system\u2019s internal workings, and have access to the system\u2019s inputs. In addition to being more robust, the quality of our paper review assignments is comparable to that of current, non-robust assignment approaches.",

    "abstract": "Searching relevant papers is a fundamental task for the elaboration of secondary studies. This task is known to be tedious and time \u2010 consuming when it is made manually, especially with the presence of several academic repositories. Recently, Semantic Scholar has emerged as a new artificial intelligence \u2010 based search engine enabling a set of valuable features. The present study investigates the role of Semantic Scholar in retrieving relevant papers for performing secondary studies in software engineering. For this sake, an examination is performed to check the ability of Semantic Scholar to locate included papers in recent and well \u2010 established secondary studies. Afterwards, a hybrid and automatic search strategy is introduced making use of Semantic Scholar as a sole search engine and it incorporates: automatic search, snowballing, and use of Computer Science Ontology (CSO) and Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK) for refining queries. The proposed strategy is validated by replicating the search of high \u2010 quality secondary studies in the software engineering field. To guarantee objectivity, a systematic search is conducted of recent secondary studies published in the field since 2015. For the coverage test, Semantic Scholar is examined to locate primary papers of selected secondary studies and identify missing venues. The proposed search strategy is used to check the ability to retrieve primary papers of each secondary study. The systematic search yielded 20 high \u2010 quality secondary studies with 1337 distinct primary papers. The coverage test revealed that Semantic Scholar covers 98.88% of the papers. The proposed search strategy enabled the full replication of 13 studies and more than 90% for the 7 remaining studies.",

    "abstract": "Providing visual summaries of scientific publications can increase information access for readers and thereby help deal with the exponential growth in the number of scientific publications. Nonetheless, efforts in providing visual publication summaries have been few and far apart, primarily focusing on the biomedical domain. This is primarily because of the limited availability of annotated gold standards, which hampers the application of robust and high-performing supervised learning techniques. To address these problems we create a new benchmark dataset for selecting figures to serve as visual summaries of publications based on their abstracts, covering several domains in computer science. Moreover, we develop a self-supervised learning approach, based on heuristic matching of inline references to figures with figure captions. Experiments in both biomedical and computer science domains show that our model is able to outperform the state of the art despite being self-supervised and therefore not relying on any annotated training data.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Motivation Neural methods to extract drug\u2013drug interactions (DDIs) from literature require a large number of annotations. In this study, we propose a novel method to effectively utilize external drug database information as well as information from large-scale plain text for DDI extraction. Specifically, we focus on drug description and molecular structure information as the drug database information. Results We evaluated our approach on the DDIExtraction 2013 shared task dataset. We obtained the following results. First, large-scale raw text information can greatly improve the performance of extracting DDIs when combined with the existing model and it shows the state-of-the-art performance. Second, each of drug description and molecular structure information is helpful to further improve the DDI performance for some specific DDI types. Finally, the simultaneous use of the drug description and molecular structure information can significantly improve the performance on all the DDI types. We showed that the plain text, the drug description information and molecular structure information are complementary and their effective combination is essential for the improvement.

    "abstract": "Equipping machines with comprehensive knowledge of the world's entities and their relationships has been a long-standing goal of AI. Over the last decade, large-scale knowledge bases, also known as knowledge graphs, have been automatically constructed from web contents and text sources, and have become a key asset for search engines. This machine knowledge can be harnessed to semantically interpret textual phrases in news, social media and web tables, and contributes to question answering, natural language processing and data analytics. This article surveys fundamental concepts and practical methods for creating and curating large knowledge bases. It covers models and methods for discovering and canonicalizing entities and their semantic types and organizing them into clean taxonomies. On top of this, the article discusses the automatic extraction of entity-centric properties. To support the long-term life-cycle and the quality assurance of machine knowledge, the article presents methods for constructing open schemas and for knowledge curation. Case studies on academic projects and industrial knowledge graphs complement the survey of concepts and methods.",

    "abstract": "Graph-to-text generation aims to generate fluent texts from graph-based data. In this paper, we investigate two recent pretrained language models (PLMs) and analyze the impact of different task-adaptive pretraining strategies for PLMs in graph-to-text generation. We present a study across three graph domains: meaning representations, Wikipedia knowledge graphs (KGs) and scientific KGs. We show that approaches based on PLMs BART and T5 achieve new state-of-the-art results and that task-adaptive pretraining strategies improve their performance even further. We report new state-of-the-art BLEU scores of 49.72 on AMR-LDC2017T10, 59.70 on WebNLG, and 25.66 on AGENDA datasets - a relative improvement of 31.8%, 4.5%, and 42.4%, respectively, with our models generating significantly more fluent texts than human references. In an extensive analysis, we identify possible reasons for the PLMs\u2019 success on graph-to-text tasks. Our findings suggest that the PLMs benefit from similar facts seen during pretraining or fine-tuning, such that they perform well even when the input graph is reduced to a simple bag of node and edge labels.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents the design and implementation of a new open-source view-based graph analytics system called Graphsurge. Graphsurge is designed to support applications that analyze multiple snapshots or views of a large-scale graph. Users program Graphsurge through a declarative graph view definition language (GVDL) to create views over input graphs and a Differential Dataflow-based programming API to write analytics computations. A key feature of GVDL is the ability to organize views into view collections, which allows Graphsurge to automatically share computation across views, without users writing any incrementalization code, by performing computations differentially. We then introduce two optimization problems that naturally arise in our setting. First is the collection ordering problem to determine the order of views that leads to minimum differences across consecutive views. We prove this problem is NP-hard and show a constant-factor approximation algorithm drawn from literature. Second is the collection splitting problem to decide on which views to run computations differentially vs from scratch, for which we present an adaptive solution that makes decisions at runtime. We present extensive experiments to demonstrate the benefits of running computations differentially for view collections and our collection ordering and splitting optimizations.",

    "title": "Multilevel Graph-Based Decision Making in Big Scholarly Data: An Approach to Identify Expert Reviewer, Finding Quality Impact Factor, Ranking Journals and Researchers",
    "abstract": "Digital libraries, such as conference papers, journal documents, books and thesis, research patents, and experiments generate a vast amount of data, named as, Scholarly Big Data. It covers scholarly related information for both researcher's perspective as well as publisher's perspective, such as academic activities, author's demography, academic social networks, etc. The relationships among Big Scholarly Data can be worthy of solving researcher as well as journal related concerns, if they are prudently treated to extract knowledge. The best approach to efficiently process these relationships is the graph. However, with the rapid growth in the number of digital articles by various libraries, the relationships raise exponentially, generating large graphs, which have become increasingly challenging to be handled in order to analyze scholarly information. On the other hand, many researchers and publishers/journals have severe concerns about the ranking control mechanisms and the consideration of quantity rather than quality. Therefore, in this paper, we proposed graph-based mechanisms to perform four critical decisions that are the need of the today's scholarly community. To improve the quality of the article, we proposed a mechanism for selecting and recommending suitable reviewers for a submitted paper based on researchers\u2019 expertise and their popularity in that particular field while avoiding conflict of interest. Also, due to shortcomings in the existing journal ranking approaches, we also designed a journal ranking mechanism including its new impact factor and relative ranking by using a modified version of traditional page ranking algorithm and excluding self-authors citations as well as self-journal citations. Similarly, researchers ranking is also important for various motives that is calculated based on the expert's field, citation count, and a number of publications while avoiding any loophole to increase the ranking such as, self-citations and wrong citations. Also, to efficiently process big graphs generated by a massive number of scholarly related relationships, we proposed an architecture that uses the parallel processing mechanism of the Hadoop ecosystem over the real-time analysis approach of Apache Spark with GraphX. Finally, the efficiency of the proposed system is evaluated in terms of processing time and throughput while implementing the designed decision mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Domain-speci\ufb01c pre-trained language models (PLMs) have achieved great success over various downstream tasks in different domains. However, existing domain-speci\ufb01c PLMs mostly rely on self-supervised learning over large amounts of domain text, without explicitly integrating domain-speci\ufb01c knowledge, which can be essential in many domains. Moreover, in knowledge-sensitive ar-eas such as the biomedical domain, knowledge is stored in multiple sources and formats, and existing biomedical PLMs either neglect them or utilize them in a limited manner. In this work, we introduce an architecture to integrate domain knowledge from diverse sources into PLMs in a parameter-ef\ufb01cient way. More speci\ufb01cally, we propose to encode domain knowledge via adapters , which are small bottleneck feed-forward networks inserted between intermediate transformer layers in PLMs. These knowledge adapters are pre-trained for individual domain knowledge sources and integrated via an attention-based knowledge controller to enrich PLMs. Taking the biomedical domain as a case study, we explore three knowledge-speci\ufb01c adapters for PLMs based on the UMLS Metathesaurus graph, the Wikipedia articles for diseases, and the semantic grouping information for biomedical concepts. Extensive experiments on different biomedical NLP tasks and datasets demonstrate the bene\ufb01ts of the proposed architecture and the knowledge-speci\ufb01c adapters across multiple PLMs.",

    "abstract": "The need to develop and disseminate solutions to address environmental challenges such as climate change or resource depletion is more urgent than ever. However, the spatial dimension of pathways towards sustainability has only attracted scholarly interest in recent years, particularly through largely parallel research on the geography of eco-innovations and the geography of sustainability transitions. By systematically reviewing the literature, this article aims to compare both lines of research, devoting special attention to the role of regions and actors. While the geography of eco-innovations field focuses on local and regional conditions that enable the emergence of environmentally friendly technologies and industries, research on the geography of sustainability transitions highlights the place-specific but multiscalar nature of socio-technical change, taking into account the role of different actor groups. The review identifies numerous complementarities between both fields that may serve as starting points to further integrate geographical work on eco-innovations and transformative change.",

    "abstract": "The paradigm of pre-training followed by finetuning has become a standard procedure for NLP tasks, with a known problem of domain shift between the pre-training and downstream corpus. Previous works have tried to mitigate this problem with additional pre-training, either on the downstream corpus itself when it is large enough, or on a manually curated unlabeled corpus of a similar domain. In this paper, we address the problem for the case when the downstream corpus is too small for additional pre-training. We propose TADPOLE, a task adapted pre-training framework based on data selection techniques adapted from Domain Adaptation. We formulate the data selection as an anomaly detection problem that unlike existing methods works well when the downstream corpus is limited in size. It results in a scalable and efficient unsupervised technique that eliminates the need for any manual data curation. We evaluate our framework on eight tasks across four different domains: Biomedical, Computer Science, News, and Movie reviews, and compare its performance against competitive baseline techniques from the area of Domain Adaptation. Our framework outperforms all the baseline methods. On small datasets with less than 5K training examples, we get a gain of 1.82% in performance with additional pre-training for only 5% steps compared to the originally pre-trained models. It also compliments some of the other techniques such as data augmentation known for boosting performance when downstream corpus is small; highest performance is achieved when data augmentation is combined with task adapted pre-training.",

The attention mechanism builds alignments between target words and source items that facilitate text generation. Previous work proposes supervised attention that uses human knowledge to guide the attention mechanism to learn better alignments. However, well-designed supervision built from ideal alignments can be costly or even infeasible. In this paper, we build a Generalized Supervised Attention method (GSA) based on quasi alignments, which specify candidate sets of alignments and are much easier to obtain than ideal alignments. We design a Summation Cross-Entropy (SCE) loss and a Supervised Multiple Attention (SMA) structure to accommodate quasi alignments. Experiments on three text generation tasks demonstrate that GSA improves generation performance and is robust against errors in attention supervision.",

    "title": "Taming Pre-trained Language Models with N-gram Representations for Low-Resource Domain Adaptation",
    "abstract": "Large pre-trained models such as BERT are known to improve different downstream NLP tasks, even when such a model is trained on a generic domain. Moreover, recent studies have shown that when large domain-specific corpora are available, continued pre-training on domain-specific data can further improve the performance of in-domain tasks. However, this practice requires significant domain-specific data and computational resources which may not always be available. In this paper, we aim to adapt a generic pretrained model with a relatively small amount of domain-specific data. We demonstrate that by explicitly incorporating multi-granularity information of unseen and domain-specific words via the adaptation of (word based) n-grams, the performance of a generic pretrained model can be greatly improved. Specifically, we introduce a Transformer-based Domain-aware N-gram Adaptor, T-DNA, to effectively learn and incorporate the semantic representation of different combinations of words in the new domain. Experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of T-DNA on eight low-resource downstream tasks from four domains. We show that T-DNA is able to achieve significant improvements compared to existing methods on most tasks using limited data with lower computational costs. Moreover, further analyses demonstrate the importance and effectiveness of both unseen words and the information of different granularities.

    "abstract": "Classifying the core textual components of a scientific paper\u2014title, author, body text, etc.\u2014 is a critical first step in automated scientific document understanding. Previous work has shown how using elementary layout information, i.e., each token\u2019s 2D position on the page, leads to more accurate classification. We introduce new methods for incorporating VIsual LAyout (VILA) structures, e.g., the grouping of page texts into text lines or text blocks, into language models to further improve performance. We show that the I-VILA approach, which simply adds special tokens denoting the boundaries of layout structures into model inputs, can lead to 1.9% Macro F1 improvements for token classification. Moreover, we design a hierarchical model, H-VILA, that encodes the text based on layout structures and record an up-to 47% inference time reduction with less than 1.5% Macro F1 loss for the text classification models. Experiments are conducted on a newly curated evaluation suite, S2-VLUE, with a novel metric measuring classification uniformity within visual groups and a new dataset of gold annotations covering papers from 19 scientific disciplines.

    "abstract": "The majority of scientific papers are distributed in PDF, which pose challenges for accessibility, especially for blind and low vision (BLV) readers. We characterize the scope of this problem by assessing the accessibility of 11,397 PDFs published 2010--2019 sampled across various fields of study, finding that only 2.4% of these PDFs satisfy all of our defined accessibility criteria. We introduce the SciA11y system to offset some of the issues around inaccessibility. SciA11y incorporates several machine learning models to extract the content of scientific PDFs and render this content as accessible HTML, with added novel navigational features to support screen reader users. An intrinsic evaluation of extraction quality indicates that the majority of HTML renders (87%) produced by our system have no or only some readability issues. We perform a qualitative user study to understand the needs of BLV researchers when reading papers, and to assess whether the SciA11y system could address these needs. We summarize our user study findings into a set of five design recommendations for accessible scientific reader systems. User response to SciA11y was positive, with all users saying they would be likely to use the system in the future, and some stating that the system, if available, would become their primary workflow. We successfully produce HTML renders for over 12M papers, of which an open access subset of 1.5M are available for browsing at https://scia11y.org/.",

The majority of articles focused on the integration of ethics into introductory computer science courses, in particular those targeting non-majors. Models derived from a larger data set of research abstracts on ethics in computing, revealed additional topics in human-computer interaction and artificial intelligence, currently underrepresented in computer science education research. The agreement between automatic and manual topic assignments was 89%. Therefore, our approach provides a time-efficient and reproducible evaluation system to support curricular decision-making.",

As a widely used database, author ID of PubMed is not officially provided by National Institutes of Health (NIH), that restrict some identifier-based researches or systems. This study exploited three open bibliographic databases Aminer, Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG) and Semantic Scholar (S2) to associate author ID for PubMed. For this purpose, paper linking and author linking was performed in order to mine paper and author links between PubMed and these databases. Performance of author name disambiguation (AND) was evaluated on two datasets. Our findings suggested that, S2 contains full volume of PubMed regarding link completeness. With respect to correctness of author ID, S2 and MAG achieved better performance than Aminer. The best F1 score of there available identifiers is below 90%, indicate AND for large scale database remain as a difficult task and efforts are being need for further improvement. We made the final dataset publicly available for facilitating future research.",

    "abstract": "A major challenge in fine-tuning deep learning models for automatic summarization is the need for large domain specific datasets. One of the barriers to curating such data from resources like online publications is navigating the license regulations applicable to their re-use, especially for commercial purposes. As a result, despite the availability of several business journals there are no large scale datasets for summarizing business documents. In this work, we introduce Open4Business(O4B),a dataset of 17,458 open access business articles and their reference summaries. The dataset introduces a new challenge for summarization in the business domain, requiring highly abstractive and more concise summaries as compared to other existing datasets. Additionally, we evaluate existing models on it and consequently show that models trained on O4B and a 7x larger non-open access dataset achieve comparable performance on summarization. We release the dataset, along with the code which can be leveraged to similarly gather data for multiple domains.",

    "abstract": "The multidisciplinary nature of the work required for research in the COVID-19 pandemic has created new challenges for health professionals in the battle against the virus. They need to be equipped with novel tools, applications, and resources\u2014that have emerged during the pandemic\u2014to gain access to breakthrough findings; know the latest developments; and to address their specific needs for rapid data acquisition, analysis, evaluation, and reporting. Because of the complex nature of the virus, healthcare systems worldwide are severely impacted as the treatment and the vaccine for COVID-19 disease are not yet discovered. This leads to frequent changes in regulations and policies by governments and international organizations. Our analysis suggests that given the abundance of information sources, finding the most suitable application for analysis, evaluation, or reporting, is one of such challenges. However, health professionals and policy-makers need access to the most relevant, reliable, trusted, and latest information and applications that can be used in their day-to-day tasks of COVID-19 research and analysis. In this article, we present our analysis of various novel and important web-based applications that have been specifically developed during the COVID-19 pandemic and that can be used by the health professionals community to help in advancing their analysis and research. These applications comprise search portals and their associated information repositories for literature and clinical trials, data sources, tracking dashboards, and forecasting models. We present a list of the minimally essential online, web-based applications to serve a multitude of purposes, from hundreds of those developed since the beginning of the pandemic. A critical analysis is provided for the selected applications based on 17 features that can be useful for researchers and analysts for their evaluations. These features make up our evaluation framework and have not been used previously for analysis and evaluation. Therefore, knowledge of these applications will not only increase productivity but will also allow us to explore new dimensions for using existing applications with more control, better management, and greater outcome of their research. In addition, the features used in our framework can be applied for future evaluations of similar applications and health professionals can adapt them for evaluation of other applications not covered in this analysis.",

This report describes that track, assigned data and tasks, our group definitions, and our results. Our approach to bringing fairness in retrieval and re-ranking tasks with Semantic Scholar data was to extract various dimensions of author identity. These dimensions included gender and location. We developed modules for these extractions in a way that allowed us to plug them in for either of the tasks as needed. After trying different combinations of relative weights assigned to relevance, gender, and location information, we chose five runs for retrieval and five runs for re-ranking tasks. The results showed that our runs performed below par for re-ranking task, but above average for retrieval.",

    "abstract": "A large array of pretrained models are available to the biomedical NLP (BioNLP) community. Finding the best model for a particular task can be difficult and time-consuming. For many applications in the biomedical and clinical domains, it is crucial that models can be built quickly and are highly accurate. We present a large-scale study across 18 established biomedical and clinical NLP tasks to determine which of several popular open-source biomedical and clinical NLP models work well in different settings. Furthermore, we apply recent advances in pretraining to train new biomedical language models, and carefully investigate the effect of various design choices on downstream performance. Our best models perform well in all of our benchmarks, and set new State-of-the-Art in 9 tasks. We release these models in the hope that they can help the community to speed up and increase the accuracy of BioNLP and text mining applications.",

    "abstract": "With the explosive growth of biomedical literature, designing automatic tools to extract information from the literature has great significance in biomedical research. Recently, transformer-based BERT models adapted to the biomedical domain have produced leading results. However, all the existing BERT models for relation classification only utilize partial knowledge from the last layer. In this paper, we will investigate the method of utilizing the entire layer in the fine-tuning process of BERT model. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore this method. The experimental results illustrate that our method improves the BERT model performance and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on three benchmark datasets for different relation extraction tasks. In addition, further analysis indicates that the key knowledge about the relations can be learned from the last layer of BERT model.",

Now, it takes more time than ever for researchers and healthcare information professionals to find relevant information from this huge literature. Classical information retrieval (IR) systems such as PubMed, while helpful, still provide a large number of search results that needs to be examined manually. Biomedical Question answering (QA) systems on the other hand can extract and provide one direct and exact answer to a question. While huge progress has been made recently in general-domain QA. Biomedical QA still has a long way to go. The number one reason for the slow progress of biomedical QA compared to general-domain QA, is the limited number of biomedical QA datasets and the even smaller number of annotated training instances. The goal of this survey is to list and compare the available biomedical QA datasets, and to provide an overview of traditional and end-to-end neural-based biomedical QA systems.",

    "abstract": "Keeping up with the rapid growth of Deep Learning (DL) research is a daunting task. While existing scientific literature search systems provide text search capabilities and can identify similar papers, gaining an in-depth understanding of a new approach or an application is much more complicated. Many publications leverage multiple modalities to convey their findings and spread their ideas - they include pseudocode, tables, images and diagrams in addition to text, and often make publicly accessible their implementations. It is important to be able to represent and query them as well. We utilize RDF Knowledge graphs (KGs) to represent multimodal information and enable expressive querying over modalities. In our demo we present an approach for extracting KGs from different modalities, namely text, architecture images and source code. We show how graph queries can be used to get insights into different facets (modalities) of a paper, and its associated code implementation. Our innovation lies in the multimodal nature of the KG we create. While our work is of direct interest to DL researchers and practitioners, our approaches can also be leveraged in other scientific domains.",

    "abstract": "Twitter is a well-known microblogging social site where users express their views and opinions in real-time. As a result, tweets tend to contain valuable information. With the advancements of deep learning in the domain of natural language processing, extracting meaningful information from tweets has become a growing interest among natural language researchers. Applying existing language representation models to extract information from Twitter does not often produce good results. Moreover, there is no existing language representation models for text analysis specific to the social media domain. Hence, in this article, we introduce two TweetBERT models, which are domain specific language presentation models, pre-trained on millions of tweets. We show that the TweetBERT models significantly outperform the traditional BERT models in Twitter text mining tasks by more than 7% on each Twitter dataset. We also provide an extensive analysis by evaluating seven BERT models on 31 different datasets. Our results validate our hypothesis that continuously training language models on twitter corpus help performance with Twitter.",

    "abstract": "Expert search aims to find and rank experts based on a user\u2019s query. In academia, retrieving experts is an efficient way to navigate through a large amount of academic knowledge. Here, we study how different distributed representations of academic papers (i.e. embeddings) impact academic expert retrieval. We use the Microsoft Academic Graph dataset and experiment with different configurations of a document-centric voting model for retrieval. In particular, we explore the impact of the use of contextualized embeddings on search performance. We also present results for paper embeddings that incorporate citation information through retrofitting. Additionally, experiments are conducted using different techniques for assigning author weights based on author order. We observe that using contextual embeddings produced by a transformer model trained for sentence similarity tasks produces the most effective paper representations for document-centric expert retrieval. However, retrofitting the paper embeddings and using elaborate author contribution weighting strategies did not improve retrieval performance.",

    "title": "Improving Access to Scientific Literature with Knowledge Graphs",
    "abstract": "Abstract The transfer of knowledge has not changed fundamentally for many hundreds of years: It is usually document-based-formerly printed on paper as a classic essay and nowadays as PDF. With around 2.5 million new research contributions every year, researchers drown in a flood of pseudo-digitized PDF publications. As a result research is seriously weakened. In this article, we argue for representing scholarly contributions in a structured and semantic way as a knowledge graph. The advantage is that information represented in a knowledge graph is readable by machines and humans. As an example, we give an overview on the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG), a service implementing this approach. For creating the knowledge graph representation, we rely on a mixture of manual (crowd/expert sourcing) and (semi-)automated techniques. Only with such a combination of human and machine intelligence, we can achieve the required quality of the representation to allow for novel exploration and assistance services for researchers. As a result, a scholarly knowledge graph such as the ORKG can be used to give a condensed overview on the state-of-the-art addressing a particular research quest, for example as a tabular comparison of contributions according to various characteristics of the approaches. Further possible intuitive access interfaces to such scholarly knowledge graphs include domain-specific (chart) visualizations or answering of natural language questions.",

    "abstract": "To assist human review process, we build a novel ReviewRobot to automatically assign a review score and write comments for multiple categories such as novelty and meaningful comparison. A good review needs to be knowledgeable, namely that the comments should be constructive and informative to help improve the paper; and explainable by providing detailed evidence. ReviewRobot achieves these goals via three steps: (1) We perform domain-specific Information Extraction to construct a knowledge graph (KG) from the target paper under review, a related work KG from the papers cited by the target paper, and a background KG from a large collection of previous papers in the domain. (2) By comparing these three KGs, we predict a review score and detailed structured knowledge as evidence for each review category. (3) We carefully select and generalize human review sentences into templates, and apply these templates to transform the review scores and evidence into natural language comments. Experimental results show that our review score predictor reaches 71.4%-100% accuracy. Human assessment by domain experts shows that 41.7%-70.5% of the comments generated by ReviewRobot are valid and constructive, and better than human-written ones for 20% of the time. Thus, ReviewRobot can serve as an assistant for paper reviewers, program chairs and authors.",

PARADE contains paraphrases that overlap very little at the lexical and syntactic level but are semantically equivalent based on computer science domain knowledge, as well as non-paraphrases that overlap greatly at the lexical and syntactic level but are not semantically equivalent based on this domain knowledge. Experiments show that both state-of-the-art neural models and non-expert human annotators have poor performance on PARADE. For example, BERT after fine-tuning achieves an F1 score of 0.709, which is much lower than its performance on other paraphrase identification datasets. PARADE can serve as a resource for researchers interested in testing models that incorporate domain knowledge. We make our data and code freely available.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge of a disease includes information of various aspects of the disease, such as signs and symptoms, diagnosis and treatment. This disease knowledge is critical for many health-related and biomedical tasks, including consumer health question answering, medical language inference and disease name recognition. While pre-trained language models like BERT have shown success in capturing syntactic, semantic, and world knowledge from text, we find they can be further complemented by specific information like knowledge of symptoms, diagnoses, treatments, and other disease aspects. Hence, we integrate BERT with disease knowledge for improving these important tasks. Specifically, we propose a new disease knowledge infusion training procedure and evaluate it on a suite of BERT models including BERT, BioBERT, SciBERT, ClinicalBERT, BlueBERT, and ALBERT. Experiments over the three tasks show that these models can be enhanced in nearly all cases, demonstrating the viability of disease knowledge infusion. For example, accuracy of BioBERT on consumer health question answering is improved from 68.29% to 72.09%, while new SOTA results are observed in two datasets. We make our data and code freely available.",

These are natural multi-dimensional extensions of graphs that encode not only pairwise relationships but also higher-order interactions between vertices - allowing us to consider richer data, including vector fields and $n$-fold collaboration networks. We define an appropriate notion of convolution that we leverage to construct the desired convolutional neural networks. We test the SNNs on the task of imputing missing data on coauthorship complexes.",

    "title": "A narrowing of AI research?",
    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is being hailed as the latest example of a General Purpose Technology that could transform productivity and help tackle important societal challenges. This outcome is however not guaranteed: a myopic focus on short-term benefits could lock AI into technologies that turn out to be sub-optimal in the longer-run. Recent controversies about the dominance of deep learning methods and private labs in AI research suggest that the field may be getting narrower, but the evidence base is lacking. We seek to address this gap with an analysis of the thematic diversity of AI research in arXiv, a widely used pre-prints site. Having identified 110,000 AI papers in this corpus, we use hierarchical topic modelling to estimate the thematic composition of AI research, and this composition to calculate various metrics of research diversity. Our analysis suggests that diversity in AI research has stagnated in recent years, and that AI research involving private sector organisations tends to be less diverse than research in academia. This appears to be driven by a small number of prolific and narrowly-focused technology companies. Diversity in academia is bolstered by smaller institutions and research groups that may have less incentives to race and lower levels of collaboration with the private sector. We also find that private sector AI researchers tend to specialise in data and computationally intensive deep learning methods at the expense of research involving other (symbolic and statistical) AI methods, and of research that considers the societal and ethical implications of AI or applies it in domains like health. Our results suggest that there may be a rationale for policy action to prevent a premature narrowing of AI research that could reduce its societal benefits, but we note the incentive, information and scale hurdles standing in the way of such interventions.",

    "abstract": "Pre-trained BERT model has shown its amazing strength on downstream NLP tasks by fine-tuning. However, the results with fine-tuned BERT will decrease when the model is directly applied to a series of domain-specific tasks. he original fine-tuning method does not consider accurate semantics of tokens in a specific domain. Different from random selecting, we present a more efficient mask method which utilizes a pointer network to decide which tokens should be preferentially masked. The pointer network sorts tokens in a sentence by their recovery difficulty. Then we train a BERT model to predict top tokens that are replaced by [mask] in original sentences. We tested the new training approach on biomedical corpora. Experiments show that the new trained model outperforms the original BERT model in some domain-specific NLP tasks while consuming extra domain corpus.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a new method for temporal pattern analysis of scientific collaboration networks. We investigate in particular virus research activities through five epidemic or pandemic outbreaks in the recent two decades and in the ongoing pandemic with COVID-19. Our method embodies two innovative components. The first is a simple model of temporal collaboration networks with time segmented in publication time and convolved in citation history, to effectively capture and accommodate collaboration activities at mixed time scales. The second component is the novel use of graphlets to encode topological structures and to detect change and persistence in collaboration activities over time. We discover in particular two unique and universal roles of bi-fork graphlet in (1) identifying bridges among triangle clusters and (2) quantifying grassroots as the backbone of every collaboration network. We present a number of intriguing patterns and findings about the virus-research activities.",

Due to the lack of good understanding of the performance of Fork-Join structures in general, today's datacenters often operate under low resource utilization to meet stringent service level objectives (SLOs), e.g., in terms of tail and/or mean latency, for such services. Hence, to achieve high resource utilization, while meeting stringent SLOs, it is of paramount importance to be able to accurately predict the tail and/or mean latency for a broad range of Fork-Join structures of practical interests. In this article, we propose a black-box Fork-Join model that covers a wide range of Fork-Join structures for the prediction of tail and mean latency, called ForkTail and ForkMean, respectively. We derive highly computational effective, empirical expressions for tail and mean latency as functions of means and variances of task response times. Our extensive testing results based on model-based and trace-driven simulations, as well as a real-world case study in a cloud environment demonstrate that the models can consistently predict the tail and mean latency within 20 and 15 percent prediction errors at 80 and 90 percent load levels, respectively, for heavy-tailed workloads, and at any load levels for light-tailed workloads. Moreover, our sensitivity analysis demonstrates that such errors can be well compensated for with no more than 7 percent resource overprovisioning. Consequently, the proposed prediction model can be used as a powerful tool to aid the design of tail-and-mean-latency guaranteed job scheduling and resource provisioning, especially at high load, for datacenter applications.",

    "title": "Visualising Large Document Collections by Jointly Modeling Text and Network Structure",
    "abstract": "Many large text collections exhibit graph structures, either inherent to the content itself or encoded in the metadata of the individual documents. Example graphs extracted from document collections are co-author networks, citation networks, or named-entity-cooccurrence networks. Furthermore, social networks can be extracted from email corpora, tweets, or social media. When it comes to visualising these large corpora, either the textual content or the network graph are used. In this paper, we propose to incorporate both, text and graph, to not only visualise the semantic information encoded in the documents' content but also the relationships expressed by the inherent network structure. To this end, we introduce a novel algorithm based on multi-objective optimisation to jointly position embedded documents and graph nodes in a two-dimensional landscape. We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach with real-world datasets and show that we can capture the semantics of large document collections better than other visualisations based on either the content or the network information.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Purpose Research dynamics have long been a research interest. It is a macro perspective tool for discovering temporal research trends of a certain discipline or subject. A micro perspective of research dynamics, however, concerning a single researcher or a highly cited paper in terms of their citations and \u201ccitations of citations\u201d (forward chaining) remains unexplored. Design/methodology/approach In this paper, we use a cross-collection topic model to reveal the research dynamics of topic disappearance topic inheritance, and topic innovation in each generation of forward chaining. Findings For highly cited work, scientific influence exists in indirect citations. Topic modeling can reveal how long this influence exists in forward chaining, as well as its influence. Research limitations This paper measures scientific influence and indirect scientific influence only if the relevant words or phrases are borrowed or used in direct or indirect citations. Paraphrasing or semantically similar concept may be neglected in this research. Practical implications This paper demonstrates that a scientific influence exists in indirect citations through its analysis of forward chaining. This can serve as an inspiration on how to adequately evaluate research influence. Originality The main contributions of this paper are the following three aspects. First, besides research dynamics of topic inheritance and topic innovation, we model topic disappearance by using a cross-collection topic model. Second, we explore the length and character of the research impact through \u201ccitations of citations\u201d content analysis. Finally, we analyze the research dynamics of artificial intelligence researcher Geoffrey Hinton's publications and the topic dynamics of forward chaining.",

    "title": "COVID-19 Knowledge Graph: Accelerating Information Retrieval and Discovery for Scientific Literature",
    "abstract": "The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has claimed the lives of over one million people and infected more than thirty-five million people worldwide. Several search engines have surfaced to provide researchers with additional tools to find and retrieve information from the rapidly growing corpora on COVID19. These engines lack extraction and visualization tools necessary to retrieve and interpret complex relations inherent to scientific literature. Moreover, because these engines mainly rely upon semantic information, their ability to capture complex global relationships across documents is limited, which reduces the quality of similarity-based article recommendations for users. In this work, we present the COVID-19 Knowledge Graph (CKG), a heterogeneous graph for extracting and visualizing complex relationships between COVID-19 scientific articles. The CKG combines semantic information with document topological information for the application of similar document retrieval. The CKG is constructed using the latent schema of the data, and then enriched with biomedical entity information extracted from the unstructured text of articles using scalable AWS technologies to form relations in the graph. Finally, we propose a document similarity engine that leverages low-dimensional graph embeddings from the CKG with semantic embeddings for similar article retrieval. Analysis demonstrates the quality of relationships in the CKG and shows that it can be used to uncover meaningful information in COVID-19 scientific articles. The CKG helps power www.cord19.aws and is publicly available.",

    "abstract": "We describe an annotation initiative to capture the scholarly contributions in natural language processing (NLP) articles, particularly, for the articles that discuss machine learning (ML) approaches for various information extraction tasks. We develop the annotation task based on a pilot annotation exercise on 50 NLP-ML scholarly articles presenting contributions to five information extraction tasks 1. machine translation, 2. named entity recognition, 3. question answering, 4. relation classification, and 5. text classification. In this article, we describe the outcomes of this pilot annotation phase. Through the exercise we have obtained an annotation methodology; and found ten core information units that reflect the contribution of the NLP-ML scholarly investigations. The resulting annotation scheme we developed based on these information units is called NLPContributions. \nThe overarching goal of our endeavor is four-fold: 1) to find a systematic set of patterns of subject-predicate-object statements for the semantic structuring of scholarly contributions that are more or less generically applicable for NLP-ML research articles; 2) to apply the discovered patterns in the creation of a larger annotated dataset for training machine readers of research contributions; 3) to ingest the dataset into the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG) infrastructure as a showcase for creating user-friendly state-of-the-art overviews; 4) to integrate the machine readers into the ORKG to assist users in the manual curation of their respective article contributions. We envision that the NLPContributions methodology engenders a wider discussion on the topic toward its further refinement and development. Our pilot annotated dataset of 50 NLP-ML scholarly articles according to the NLPContributions scheme is openly available to the research community at this https URL.",

    "abstract": "We present a novel encoder-decoder architecture for graph-to-text generation based on Transformer, called the Graformer. With our novel graph self-attention, every node in the input graph is taken into account for the encoding of every other node - not only direct neighbors, facilitating the detection of global patterns. For this, the relation between any two nodes is characterized by the length of the shortest path between them, including the special case when there is no such path. The Graformer learns to weigh these node-node relations differently for different attention heads, thus virtually learning differently connected views of the input graph. We evaluate the Graformer on two graph-to-text generation benchmarks, the AGENDA dataset and the WebNLG challenge dataset, where it achieves strong performance while using significantly less parameters than other approaches.",

    "abstract": "Identification of new concepts in scientific literature can help power faceted search, scientific trend analysis, knowledge-base construction, and more, but current methods are lacking. Manual identification can't keep up with the torrent of new publications, while the precision of existing automatic techniques is too low for many applications. We present an unsupervised concept extraction method for scientific literature that achieves much higher precision than previous work. Our approach relies on a simple but novel intuition: each scientific concept is likely to be introduced or popularized by a single paper that is disproportionately cited by subsequent papers mentioning the concept. From a corpus of computer science papers on arXiv, we find that our method achieves a Precision@1000 of 99%, compared to 86% for prior work, and a substantially better precision-yield trade-off across the top 15,000 extractions. To stimulate research in this area, we release our code and data.",

    "abstract": "Workflows are prevalent in today's computing infrastructures. The workflow model support various different domains, from machine learning to finance and from astronomy to chemistry. Different Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements and other desires of both users and providers makes workflow scheduling a tough problem, especially since resource providers need to be as efficient as possible with their resources to be competitive. To a newcomer or even an experienced researcher, sifting through the vast amount of articles can be a daunting task. Questions regarding the difference techniques, policies, emerging areas, and opportunities arise. Surveys are an excellent way to cover these questions, yet surveys rarely publish their tools and data on which it is based. Moreover, the communities that are behind these articles are rarely studied. We attempt to address these shortcomings in this work. We focus on four areas within workflow scheduling: 1) the workflow formalism, 2) workflow allocation, 3) resource provisioning, and 4) applications and services. Each part features one or more taxonomies, a view of the community, important and emerging keywords, and directions for future work. We introduce and make open-source an instrument we used to combine and store article meta-data. Using this meta-data, we 1) obtain important keywords overall and per year, per community, 2) identify keywords growing in importance, 3) get insight into the structure and relations within each community, and 4) perform a systematic literature survey per part to validate and complement our taxonomies.",

    "abstract": "Representation learning is a critical ingredient for natural language processing systems. Recent Transformer language models like BERT learn powerful textual representations, but these models are targeted towards token- and sentence-level training objectives and do not leverage information on inter-document relatedness, which limits their document-level representation power. For applications on scientific documents, such as classification and recommendation, accurate embeddings of documents are a necessity. We propose SPECTER, a new method to generate document-level embedding of scientific papers based on pretraining a Transformer language model on a powerful signal of document-level relatedness: the citation graph. Unlike existing pretrained language models, Specter can be easily applied to downstream applications without task-specific fine-tuning. Additionally, to encourage further research on document-level models, we introduce SciDocs, a new evaluation benchmark consisting of seven document-level tasks ranging from citation prediction, to document classification and recommendation. We show that Specter outperforms a variety of competitive baselines on the benchmark.",

Compared to other toolkits, SciWING follows a full neural pipeline and provides a Python inter-face for SDP. When needed, SciWING provides fine-grained control for rapid experimentation with different models by swapping and stacking different modules. Transfer learning from general and scientific documents specific pre-trained transformers (i.e., BERT, SciBERT, etc.) can be performed. SciWING incorporates ready-to-use web and terminal-based applications and demonstrations to aid adoption and development. The toolkit is available from http://sciwing.io and the demos are available at http://rebrand.ly/sciwing-demo.",

    "abstract": "Computational analysis and modeling of the evolution of trends is an important area of research in Natural Language Processing (NLP) because of its socio-economic impact. However, no large publicly available benchmark for trend detection currently exists, making a comparative evaluation of methods impossible. We remedy this situation by publishing the benchmark TRENDNERT, consisting of a set of gold trends and downtrends and document labels that is available as an unrestricted download, and a large underlying document collection that can also be obtained for free. We propose Mean Average Precision (MAP) as an evaluation measure for trend detection and apply this measure in an investigation of several baselines.",

    "abstract": "Little is known about the trustworthiness of predictions made by knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models. In this paper we take initial steps toward this direction by investigating the calibration of KGE models, or the extent to which they output confidence scores that reflect the expected correctness of predicted knowledge graph triples. We first conduct an evaluation under the standard closed-world assumption (CWA), in which predicted triples not already in the knowledge graph are considered false, and show that existing calibration techniques are effective for KGE under this common but narrow assumption. Next, we introduce the more realistic but challenging open-world assumption (OWA), in which unobserved predictions are not considered true or false until ground-truth labels are obtained. Here, we show that existing calibration techniques are much less effective under the OWA than the CWA, and provide explanations for this discrepancy. Finally, to motivate the utility of calibration for KGE from a practitioner's perspective, we conduct a unique case study of human-AI collaboration, showing that calibrated predictions can improve human performance in a knowledge graph completion task.",

    "abstract": "This paper addresses machine learning models that embed knowledge graph entities and relationships toward the goal of predicting unseen triples, which is an important task because most knowledge graphs are by nature incomplete. We posit that while offline link prediction accuracy using embeddings has been steadily improving on benchmark datasets, such embedding models have limited practical utility in real-world knowledge graph completion tasks because it is not clear when their predictions should be accepted or trusted. To this end, we propose to calibrate knowledge graph embedding models to output reliable confidence estimates for predicted triples. In crowdsourcing experiments, we demonstrate that calibrated confidence scores can make knowledge graph embeddings more useful to practitioners and data annotators in knowledge graph completion tasks. We also release two resources from our evaluation tasks: An enriched version of the FB15K benchmark and a new knowledge graph dataset extracted from Wikidata.",

    "title": "Explanation-Based Tuning of Opaque Machine Learners with Application to Paper Recommendation",
    "abstract": "Research in human-centered AI has shown the benefits of machine-learning systems that can explain their predictions. Methods that allow users to tune a model in response to the explanations are similarly useful. While both capabilities are well-developed for transparent learning models (e.g., linear models and GA2Ms), and recent techniques (e.g., LIME and SHAP) can generate explanations for opaque models, no method currently exists for tuning of opaque models in response to explanations. This paper introduces LIMEADE, a general framework for tuning an arbitrary machine learning model based on an explanation of the model's prediction. We apply our framework to Semantic Sanity, a neural recommender system for scientific papers, and report on a detailed user study, showing that our framework leads to significantly higher perceived user control, trust, and satisfaction.",

    "abstract": "We introduce the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Medicine) Dataset for Scientific Entity Extraction, Classification, and Resolution, version 1.0 (STEM-ECR v1.0). The STEM-ECR v1.0 dataset has been developed to provide a benchmark for the evaluation of scientific entity extraction, classification, and resolution tasks in a domain-independent fashion. It comprises abstracts in 10 STEM disciplines that were found to be the most prolific ones on a major publishing platform. We describe the creation of such a multidisciplinary corpus and highlight the obtained findings in terms of the following features: 1) a generic conceptual formalism for scientific entities in a multidisciplinary scientific context; 2) the feasibility of the domain-independent human annotation of scientific entities under such a generic formalism; 3) a performance benchmark obtainable for automatic extraction of multidisciplinary scientific entities using BERT-based neural models; 4) a delineated 3-step entity resolution procedure for human annotation of the scientific entities via encyclopedic entity linking and lexicographic word sense disambiguation; and 5) human evaluations of Babelfy returned encyclopedic links and lexicographic senses for our entities. Our findings cumulatively indicate that human annotation and automatic learning of multidisciplinary scientific concepts as well as their semantic disambiguation in a wide-ranging setting as STEM is reasonable.",

Scientific research offers a challenging environment where to learn a model for the creative process. In fact, scientific research is a creative act in the formal settings of the scientific method and this creative act is described in articles. \nIn this paper, we dare to introduce the novel, scientifically and philosophically challenging task of Generating Abstracts of Scientific Papers from abstracts of cited papers (GASP) as a text-to-text task to investigate scientific creativity, To foster research in this novel, challenging task, we prepared a dataset by using services where that solve the problem of copyright and, hence, the dataset is public available with its standard split. Finally, we experimented with two vanilla summarization systems to start the analysis of the complexity of the GASP task.",

Such systems depend on formally represented knowledge in computer systems, often in the form of knowledge graphs. Here we survey recent progress in systems that use formally represented knowledge to address data science problems in both clinical and biological domains, as well as progress on approaches for creating knowledge graphs. Major themes include the relationships between knowledge graphs and machine learning, the use of natural language processing to construct knowledge graphs, and the expansion of novel knowledge-based approaches to clinical and biological domains.",

    "abstract": "Realistic, relevant, and reproducible experiments often need input traces collected from real-world environments. In this work, we focus on traces of workflows\u2014common in datacenters, clouds, and HPC infrastructures. We show that the state-of-the-art in using workflow-traces raises important issues: (1) the use of realistic traces is infrequent and (2) the use of realistic, <italic>open-access</italic> traces even more so. Alleviating these issues, we introduce the Workflow Trace Archive (WTA), an open-access archive of workflow traces from diverse computing infrastructures and tooling to parse, validate, and analyze traces.

To emphasize the importance of trace diversity, we characterize the WTA contents and analyze in simulation the impact of trace diversity on experiment results. Our results indicate significant differences in characteristics, properties, and workflow structures between workload sources, domains, and fields.",

    "abstract": ". Citation recommendation systems for the scienti\ufb01c literature, to help authors \ufb01nd papers that should be cited, have the potential to speed up discoveries and uncover new routes for scienti\ufb01c exploration. We treat this task as a ranking problem, which we tackle with a two-stage approach: candidate generation followed by re-ranking. Within this framework, we adapt to the scienti\ufb01c domain a proven combination based on \u201cbag of words\u201d retrieval followed by re-scoring with a BERT model. We experimentally show the e\ufb00ects of domain adaptation, both in terms of pretraining on in-domain data and exploiting in-domain vocabulary. In addition, we evaluate eleven pretrained transformer models and an-alyze some unexpected failure cases. On three di\ufb00erent collections from di\ufb00erent scienti\ufb01c disciplines, our models perform close to or at the state of the art in the citation recommendation task.",

They are convenient and assist users by keeping the focus on relevant topics, but they are often black boxes and users typically do not know why certain entries appear in their profile. As transparency and provenance are essential for researchers, in this paper, we introduce ScholarLensViz, a visualization component for scholarly user profiles displaying a scholar\u2019s research competences including the provenance. It also provides visualizations to inspect the diversity of a profile and to analyze the semantic similarity of the profile entries.",

    "abstract": "Citation recommendation systems for the scientific literature, to help authors find papers that should be cited, have the potential to speed up discoveries and uncover new routes for scientific exploration. We treat this task as a ranking problem, which we tackle with a two-stage approach: candidate generation followed by reranking. Within this framework, we adapt to the scientific domain a proven combination based on \u201cbag of words\u201d retrieval followed by re-scoring with a BERT model. We experimentally show the effects of domain adaptation, both in terms of pretraining on in-domain data and exploiting in-domain vocabulary. In addition, we introduce a novel navigation-based document expansion strategy to enrich the candidate documents processed by our neural models. On three different collections from different scientific disciplines, we achieve the best-reported results in the citation recommendation task.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Purpose Research dynamics have long been a research interest. It is a macro perspective tool for discovering temporal research trends of a certain discipline or subject. A micro perspective of research dynamics, however, concerning a single researcher or a highly cited paper in terms of their citations and \u201ccitations of citations\u201d (forward chaining) remains unexplored. Design/methodology/approach In this paper, we use a cross-collection topic model to reveal the research dynamics of topic disappearance topic inheritance, and topic innovation in each generation of forward chaining. Findings For highly cited work, scientific influence exists in indirect citations. Topic modeling can reveal how long this influence exists in forward chaining, as well as its influence. Research limitations This paper measures scientific influence and indirect scientific influence only if the relevant words or phrases are borrowed or used in direct or indirect citations. Paraphrasing or semantically similar concept may be neglected in this research. Practical implications This paper demonstrates that a scientific influence exists in indirect citations through its analysis of forward chaining. This can serve as an inspiration on how to adequately evaluate research influence. Originality The main contributions of this paper are the following three aspects. First, besides research dynamics of topic inheritance and topic innovation, we model topic disappearance by using a cross-collection topic model. Second, we explore the length and character of the research impact through \u201ccitations of citations\u201d content analysis. Finally, we analyze the research dynamics of artificial intelligence researcher Geoffrey Hinton's publications and the topic dynamics of forward chaining.",

    "abstract": "In our participation to the TREC 2020 Fair Ranking Track, the University of Glasgow Terrier Team investigated a new approach for organically uncovering latent communities of authors that we wish to be fair to. Our deployed approach leverages a co-embedding model to jointly model a document\u2019s attributes, such as the document\u2019s authors, and the citation link graph of the documents in a collection, within a single embedding space. This network coembedding is then used as input to a community detection approach that automatically updates the identified communities for each instance of a repeated query. Moreover, we experiment with two different ranking strategies to provide a fair exposure to different communities, and the authors within the communities, over time. Our first ranking strategy is inspired by the concepts of coverage and novelty from search results diversification, while our second ranking strategy leverages a data fusion approach for prioritising different communities over time.",

    "abstract": "In the present digital age, much information is organized as knowledge graphs, where numerous techniques have been developed to retrieve relevant subgraphs. As the information represented in such retrieved subgraphs is not readily suitable for human laymen users to understand, it is useful to develop approaches to represent such information in natural language. In this work, we propose a neural modeling framework that jointly learns to (1) generate topically coherent and informative text by computing the representation of the input knowledge graph for each sentential context, and to (2) generate text in a sentence-by-sentence order to improve tractability for long sequence generation. Our proposed approach improves the accuracy of text generation using objective metrics such as BLEU and METEOR in comparison to established baselines such as graph transformer networks on the AGENDA dataset. Human evaluations also show that our proposed model compares favorably with established baselines on the dimensions of informativeness and coherence.",

    "abstract": "This research looks to explore the requirements, development, and efficacy of the online research paper tool-Research Exchange. Based on surveying graduate and undergraduate research students, it was found that getting started with research is a huge undertaking and requires constant guidance of immediate peers and professors. To address these issues, a collaborative online research tool was designed to help young researchers understand concepts on the fly. To understand whether the tool helps achieving the desired goal, usability studies were conducted to understand the usability and functionality issues of the tool. It was found that collaboration using annotations was extremely beneficial for users which were in line with our findings from the requirement phase. Additionally, it was noted that users appreciated the online reader and were open to trying it from the existing pdf solutions. However, many users noted several additional features that would be necessary to make this product useful. Future work involves improving the prototype and integration of the OpenReview APIs for large scale deployment. Our final prototype can be found on http://researchexchange.cs.umass.edu:3000/.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we aim to develop a self-supervised grounding of Covid-related medical text based on the actual spatial relationships between the referred anatomical concepts. More specifically, we learn to project sentences into a physical space defined by a three-dimensional anatomical atlas, allowing for a visual approach to navigating Covid-related literature. We design a straightforward and empirically effective training objective to reduce the curated data dependency issue. We use BERT as the main building block of our model and perform a quantitative analysis that demonstrates that the model learns a context-aware mapping. We illustrate two potential use-cases for our approach, one in interactive, 3D data exploration, and the other in document retrieval. To accelerate research in this direction, we make public all trained models, codebase and the developed tools, which can be accessed at https://github.com/gorjanradevski/macchina/.",

    "abstract": "Searching for similar documents and exploring major themes covered across groups of documents are common activities when browsing collections of scientific papers. This manual knowledge-intensive task can become less tedious and even lead to unexpected relevant findings if unsupervised algorithms are applied to help researchers. Most text mining algorithms represent documents in a common feature space that abstract them away from the specific sequence of words used in them. Probabilistic Topic Models reduce that feature space by annotating documents with thematic information. Over this low-dimensional latent space some locality-sensitive hashing algorithms have been proposed to perform document similarity search. However, thematic information gets hidden behind hash codes, preventing thematic exploration and limiting the explanatory capability of topics to justify content-based similarities. This paper presents a novel hashing algorithm based on approximate nearest-neighbor techniques that uses hierarchical sets of topics as hash codes. It not only performs efficient similarity searches, but also allows extending those queries with thematic restrictions explaining the similarity score from the most relevant topics. Extensive evaluations on both scientific and industrial text datasets validate the proposed algorithm in terms of accuracy and efficiency.",

Each paper is represented with rich paper metadata (title, authors, abstract, etc.), and where available: cleaned full text, section headers, figure and table captions, and parsed bibliography entries. In-line citation mentions in full text are linked to their corresponding bibliography entries, which are in turn linked to in-corpus cited papers, forming the edges of a contextual citation graph. To our knowledge, this is the largest publicly available contextual citation graph; the full text alone is the largest parsed academic text corpus publicly available. We demonstrate the ability to identify similar papers using these citation contexts and propose several applications for language modeling and citation-related tasks.",

    "abstract": "We study the problem of object detection over scanned images of scientific documents. We consider images that contain objects of varying aspect ratios and sizes and range from coarse elements such as tables and figures to fine elements such as equations and section headers. We find that current object detectors fail to produce properly localized region proposals over such page objects. We revisit the original R-CNN model and present a method for generating fine-grained proposals over document elements. We also present a region embedding model that uses the convolutional maps of a proposal's neighbors as context to produce an embedding for each proposal. This region embedding is able to capture the semantic relationships between a target region and its surrounding context. Our end-to-end model produces an embedding for each proposal, then classifies each proposal by using a multi-head attention model that attends to the most important neighbors of a proposal. To evaluate our model, we collect and annotate a dataset of publications from heterogeneous journals. We show that our model, referred to as Attentive-RCNN, yields a 17% mAP improvement compared to standard object detection models.",

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its relation with societies is increasingly becoming an interesting object of study from the perspective of sociology and other disciplines. Theories such as the Economy of Conventions (EC) are usually applied in the context of interpersonal relations but there is still a clear lack of studies around how this and other theories can shed light on interactions between human an autonomous systems. This work is focused into studying a preliminary step that is a key enabler for the subsequent interaction between machines and humans: how the processes of researching, designing and developing AI related systems reflect different moral registers, represented by conventions within the EC. Having a better understanding of those conventions guiding the advances in AI is considered as the first and required advance to understand the conventions afterwards reflected by those autonomous systems in the interactions with societies. For this purpose, we develop an iterative tool based on active learning to label a data set from the field of AI and Machine Learning (ML) research and present preliminary results of a supervised classifier trained on these conventions. To further demonstrate the feasibility of the approach, the results are contrasted with a classifier trained on software conventions.",

    "abstract": "Compared to natural images, understanding scientific figures is particularly hard for machines. However, there is a valuable source of information in scientific literature that until now has remained untapped: the correspondence between a figure and its caption. In this paper we investigate what can be learnt by looking at a large number of figures and reading their captions, and introduce a figure-caption correspondence learning task that makes use of our observations. Training visual and language networks without supervision other than pairs of unconstrained figures and captions is shown to successfully solve this task. We also show that transferring lexical and semantic knowledge from a knowledge graph significantly enriches the resulting features. Finally, we demonstrate the positive impact of such features in other tasks involving scientific text and figures, like multi-modal classification and machine comprehension for question answering, outperforming supervised baselines and ad-hoc approaches.",

    "abstract": "Language models are at the heart of numerous works, notably in the text mining and information retrieval communities. These statistical models aim at extracting word distributions, from simple unigram models to recurrent approaches with latent variables that capture subtle dependencies in texts. However, those models are learned from word sequences only, and authors' identities, as well as publication dates, are seldom considered. We propose a neural model, based on recurrent language modeling, which aims at capturing language diffusion tendencies in author communities through time. By conditioning language models with author and temporal vector states, we are able to leverage the latent dependencies between the text contexts. This allows us to beat several temporal and non-temporal language baselines on two real-world corpora, and to learn meaningful author representations that vary through time.",

    "abstract": "As a step toward better document-level understanding, we explore classification of a sequence of sentences into their corresponding categories, a task that requires understanding sentences in context of the document. Recent successful models for this task have used hierarchical models to contextualize sentence representations, and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) to incorporate dependencies between subsequent labels. In this work, we show that pretrained language models, BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) in particular, can be used for this task to capture contextual dependencies without the need for hierarchical encoding nor a CRF. Specifically, we construct a joint sentence representation that allows BERT Transformer layers to directly utilize contextual information from all words in all sentences. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on four datasets, including a new dataset of structured scientific abstracts.",

    "abstract": "Building effective text generation systems requires three critical components: content selection, text planning, and surface realization, and traditionally they are tackled as separate problems. Recent all-in-one style neural generation models have made impressive progress, yet they often produce outputs that are incoherent and unfaithful to the input. To address these issues, we present an end-to-end trained two-step generation model, where a sentence-level content planner first decides on the keyphrases to cover as well as a desired language style, followed by a surface realization decoder that generates relevant and coherent text. For experiments, we consider three tasks from domains with diverse topics and varying language styles: persuasive argument construction from Reddit, paragraph generation for normal and simple versions of Wikipedia, and abstract generation for scientific articles. Automatic evaluation shows that our system can significantly outperform competitive comparisons. Human judges further rate our system generated text as more fluent and correct, compared to the generations by its variants that do not consider language style.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a multi-task learning approach to natural language inference (NLI) and question entailment (RQE) in the biomedical domain. Recognizing textual inference relations and question similarity can address the issue of answering new consumer health questions by mapping them to Frequently Asked Questions on reputed websites like the NIH. We show that leveraging information from parallel tasks across domains along with medical knowledge integration allows our model to learn better biomedical feature representations. Our final models for the NLI and RQE tasks achieve the 4th and 2nd rank on the shared-task leaderboard respectively.",

    "abstract": "While the fast-paced inception of novel tasks and new datasets helps foster active research in a community towards interesting directions, keeping track of the abundance of research activity in different areas on different datasets is likely to become increasingly difficult. The community could greatly benefit from an automatic system able to summarize scientific results, e.g., in the form of a leaderboard. In this paper we build two datasets and develop a framework (TDMS-IE) aimed at automatically extracting task, dataset, metric and score from NLP papers, towards the automatic construction of leaderboards. Experiments show that our model outperforms several baselines by a large margin. Our model is a first step towards automatic leaderboard construction, e.g., in the NLP domain.",

    "abstract": "Software testing can be a helpful practice to certify the quality of a product. However, there are programs which are hard, if not impossible, to determine the expected outputs. This problem is called the \"oracle problem\". Metamorphic testing (MT) is an approach that aims to alleviate this problem by setting a series of relations, called metamorphic relations (MRs). This paper applies MT through a user-oriented approach and the following MRs: MPublished, MPTitle, MPShuffleJD and Top1Absent as a strategy for evaluating, verifying, and validating four Academic Search Engines (ASEs): ACM, IEEE, ScienceDirect, and Springer. Therefore, we conducted an experimental study to analyze how MRs can contribute to verifying the correctness of the properties of ASEs. Results indicate that the ASEs have performed differently in their execution for each MR analyzed. This shows that the algorithms of the scientific search engines have different behaviors among the characteristics analyzed. These behaviors may not be properly characterized by a possible failure, but by a simple design choice. On the other hand, the approach is useful for search engine users that need to be sure that the ASEs behave as expected during a search, as the results of secondary studies strongly depend on the correct behavior of the scientific search engine used.",

    "abstract": "We present a method for automatically organizing and evaluating the quality of different publishing venues in Computer Science. Since this method only requires paper publication data as its input, we can demonstrate our method on a large portion of the DBLP dataset, spanning 50 years, with millions of authors and thousands of publishing venues. By formulating venue authorship as a regression problem and targeting metrics of interest, we obtain venue scores for every conference and journal in our dataset. The obtained scores can also provide a per-year model of conference quality, showing how fields develop and change over time. Additionally, these venue scores can be used to evaluate individual academic authors and academic institutions. We show that using venue scores to evaluate both authors and institutions produces quantitative measures that are comparable to approaches using citations or peer assessment. In contrast to many other existing evaluation metrics, our use of large-scale, openly available data enables this approach to be repeatable and transparent.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge graphs (KGs), i.e. representation of information as a semantic graph, provide a significant test bed for many tasks including question answering, recommendation, and link prediction. Various amount of scholarly metadata have been made vailable as knowledge graphs from the diversity of data providers and agents. However, these high-quantities of data remain far from quality criteria in terms of completeness while growing at a rapid pace. Most of the attempts in completing such KGs are following traditional data digitization, harvesting and collaborative curation approaches. Whereas, advanced AI-related approaches such as embedding models - specifically designed for such tasks - are usually evaluated for standard benchmarks such as Freebase and Wordnet. The tailored nature of such datasets prevents those approaches to shed the lights on more accurate discoveries. Application of such models on domain-specific KGs takes advantage of enriched meta-data and provides accurate results where the underlying domain can enormously benefit. In this work, the TransE embedding model is reconciled for a specific link prediction task on scholarly metadata. The results show a significant shift in the accuracy and performance evaluation of the model on a dataset with scholarly metadata. The newly proposed version of TransE obtains 99.9% for link prediction task while original TransE gets 95%. In terms of accuracy and Hit@10, TransE outperforms other embedding models such as ComplEx, TransH and TransR experimented over scholarly knowledge graphs",

    "abstract": "In the context of multiple views, coordination is essential to navigate and grasp the relationships lying behind the different juxtaposed views. Linked highlighting is a typical example of coordination where a subset of the data points is emphasized simultaneously on all views. The strength of this approach is that the selected data can be studied within its context. Other approaches have been used to implement coordination such as using varying levels of transparency or visual links. We propose to use spatial distortion to contribute a similar effect in multiple views. It is particularly suited to the context of multiple views since it alleviates the lack of screen space by reallocating it based on a certain definition of user interest. The proposed method targets coordination between views that represent the same entities and readily adapts to various visualization forms. It is based on a user degree-of-interest function, defined on these entities, that acts as a common ground for the distortion of all views. Views are distorted such that empty areas and areas holding entities of lesser interest are compressed to the benefit of areas holding entities of higher interest. To demonstrate its feasibility and versatility, we describe how to technically apply our approach to several common visualization techniques.",

    "abstract": "Generating texts which express complex ideas spanning multiple sentences requires a structured representation of their content (document plan), but these representations are prohibitively expensive to manually produce. In this work, we address the problem of generating coherent multi-sentence texts from the output of an information extraction system, and in particular a knowledge graph. Graphical knowledge representations are ubiquitous in computing, but pose a significant challenge for text generation techniques due to their non-hierarchical nature, collapsing of long-distance dependencies, and structural variety. We introduce a novel graph transforming encoder which can leverage the relational structure of such knowledge graphs without imposing linearization or hierarchical constraints. Incorporated into an encoder-decoder setup, we provide an end-to-end trainable system for graph-to-text generation that we apply to the domain of scientific text. Automatic and human evaluations show that our technique produces more informative texts which exhibit better document structure than competitive encoder-decoder methods.",

    "abstract": "Obtaining large-scale annotated data for NLP tasks in the scientific domain is challenging and expensive. We release SciBERT, a pretrained contextualized embedding model based on BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) to address the lack of high-quality, large-scale labeled scientific data. SciBERT leverages unsupervised pretraining on a large multi-domain corpus of scientific publications to improve performance on downstream scientific NLP tasks. We evaluate on a suite of tasks including sequence tagging, sentence classification and dependency parsing, with datasets from a variety of scientific domains. We demonstrate statistically significant improvements over BERT and achieve new state-of-the-art results on several of these tasks.",

    "abstract": "We propose ReviewerNet, an online, interactive visualization system aimed to improve the reviewer selection process in the academic domain. Given a paper submitted for publication, we assume that good candidate reviewers can be chosen among the authors of a small set of relevant and pertinent papers; ReviewerNet supports the construction of such set of papers, by visualizing and exploring a literature citation network. Then, the system helps to select reviewers that are both well distributed in the scientific community and that do not have any conflict-of-interest, by visualising the careers and co-authorship relations of candidate reviewers. The system is publicly available, and it has been evaluated by a set of experienced researchers in the field of Computer Graphics.",

We release SciBERT, a pretrained language model based on BERT (Devlin et. al., 2018) to address the lack of high-quality, large-scale labeled scientific data. SciBERT leverages unsupervised pretraining on a large multi-domain corpus of scientific publications to improve performance on downstream scientific NLP tasks. We evaluate on a suite of tasks including sequence tagging, sentence classification and dependency parsing, with datasets from a variety of scientific domains. We demonstrate statistically significant improvements over BERT and achieve new state-of-the-art results on several of these tasks. The code and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/allenai/scibert/.",

    "abstract": "Despite recent advances in natural language processing, many statistical models for processing text perform extremely poorly under domain shift. Processing biomedical and clinical text is a critically important application area of natural language processing, for which there are few robust, practical, publicly available models. This paper describes scispaCy, a new Python library and models for practical biomedical/scientific text processing, which heavily leverages the spaCy library. We detail the performance of two packages of models released in scispaCy and demonstrate their robustness on several tasks and datasets. Models and code are available at https://allenai.github.io/scispacy/.",

    "abstract": "We introduce GrapAL (Graph database of Academic Literature), a versatile tool for exploring and investigating a knowledge base of scientific literature that was semi-automatically constructed using NLP methods. GrapAL fills many informational needs expressed by researchers. At the core of GrapAL is a Neo4j graph database with an intuitive schema and a simple query language. In this paper, we describe the basic elements of GrapAL, how to use it, and several use cases such as finding experts on a given topic for peer reviewing, discovering indirect connections between biomedical entities, and computing citation-based metrics. We open source the demo code to help other researchers develop applications that build on GrapAL.",

    "abstract": "Despite improved digital access to scholarly knowledge in recent decades, scholarly communication remains exclusively document-based. In this form, scholarly knowledge is hard to process automatically. We present the first steps towards a knowledge graph based infrastructure that acquires scholarly knowledge in machine actionable form thus enabling new possibilities for scholarly knowledge curation, publication and processing. The primary contribution is to present, evaluate and discuss multi-modal scholarly knowledge acquisition, combining crowdsourced and automated techniques. We present the results of the first user evaluation of the infrastructure with the participants of a recent international conference. Results suggest that users were intrigued by the novelty of the proposed infrastructure and by the possibilities for innovative scholarly knowledge processing it could enable.",

Scientific knowledge remains locked in representations that are inadequate for machine processing. In this article, we present initial steps towards next generation digital libraries and infrastructures that acquire, curate, publish and process scholarly knowledge semantically, in machine readable form leveraging knowledge graphs. The primary contribution of this work is to present and discuss early developments of a system designed to crowdsource machine readable descriptions of research contributions published in scholarly articles and a knowledge graph infrastructure for description storage and access. We report on the results of a first experimental evaluation of the concept and its implementation with the participants of a recent international conference. The results suggest that users find such a system useful, and the possibilities it could enable intriguing.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, entity-based ranking models have led to exciting breakthroughs in the research of information retrieval. Compared with traditional retrieval models, entity-based representation enables a better understanding of queries and documents. However, the existing entity-based models neglect the importance of entities in a document. This paper attempts to explore the effects of the importance of entities in a document. Specifically, the dataset analysis is conducted which verifies the correlation between the importance of entities in a document and document ranking. Then, this paper enhances two entity-based models\u2014toy model and Explicit Semantic Ranking model (ESR)\u2014by considering the importance of entities. In contrast to the existing models, the enhanced models assign the weights of entities according to their importance. Experimental results show that the enhanced toy model and ESR can outperform the two baselines by as much as 4.57% and 2.74% on NDCG@20 respectively, and further experiments reveal that the strength of the enhanced models is more evident on long queries and the queries where ESR fails, confirming the effectiveness of taking the importance of entities into account.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes an attributed network growth model. Despite the knowledge that individuals use limited resources to form connections to similar others, we lack an understanding of how local and resource-constrained mechanisms explain the emergence of structural properties found in real-world networks. We make three contributions. First, we propose a simple and accurate model of attributed network growth that jointly explains the emergence of in-degree, local clustering, clustering-degree relationship and attribute mixing patterns. Second, we make use of biased random walks to develop a model that forms edges locally, without recourse to global information. Third, we account for multiple sociological phenomena: bounded rationality; structural constraints; triadic closure; attribute homophily; preferential attachment. Our experiments show that the proposed Attributed Random Walk (ARW) model accurately preserves network structure and attribute mixing patterns of real-world networks; it improves upon the performance of eight well-known models by a significant margin of 2.5-10 \u00d7 .",

    "abstract": "Software Testing has always been a crucial part of the software development life cycle. Choosing a testing system that will most-likely identify faults in implementation might heavily influence either the cost and outcome of a project. As a matter of fact, authors provide empirical evaluations to showcase the major fortes of their frameworks. By classifying such publications and revealing strategies based on not only intrinsic attributes of a paper but also their role in the bibliographic network, it is possible to trace shared tasks and priorities of certain software testing research areas. Understanding the major qualities and flaws of the current software testing research community may lead to a decisive improvement of the software development process as a whole. In this thesis, common strategies behind assessing testing systems are analyzed. The main goal of the research is to find a common ground for software testing contributions in order to understand the latest situation of state-of-the-art software testing tool evaluations. By reflecting on properties that influence the reproducibility of an evaluation, publication data is created that can be observed in detail in a node-link-directed visualization. The collected data and insight is used to determine whether referencing patterns in certain research areas occur and can be used to imply properties of a publication concerning their reproducibility and overall quality.",

    "abstract": "Providing users with tools to discover and explore semantic information is a hot research topic in exploratory search. Despite advancements in tools such as faceted search interfaces, a large amount of insights is still hard to obtain for users. Users are thus required to use general purpose database query languages such as SPARQL that require sophisticated technical skills, domainknowledge, and manual effort. In this work, we make searching knowledge graphs like searching the web. This is accomplished by generating stories from a knowledge graph which contain insights about its entities, their influence, reach, and social activity. A search interface then allows users to explore the graph by viewing and searching the stories. Our first contribution in this thesis is building a framework for generating stories containing analysis insights from knowledge graphs. The framework contains three different components: a data querying component, a data analysis and interpretation component, and a story generation component. In our experiments, it generated 450 stories from a knowledge graph with 500,000 academic papers from the Semantic Scholar Open Research Corpus. Our second contribution is designing and implementing a web interface to view and search the stories using a novel search approach. It provides a keyword search component that allows users to search and navigate insights about stories, graph entities, and their interconnections. Finally we evaluate our interface with 5 participants taking a Computer System Usability Questionnaire (CSUQ) usability test. Participants positively rated our interface with an overall usability score of 1.70 on a 7-point Likert scale between -3 (strongly disagree) and 3 (strongly agree).",

    "abstract": "Natural language processing can assist scientists to leverage the increasing amount of information contained in scientific bibliography. The current trend, based on deep learning and embeddings, uses representations at the (sub)word level that require large amounts of training data and neural architectures with millions of parameters to learn successful language models, like BERT. However, these representations may not be well suited for the scientific domain, where it is common to find complex terms, e.g. multi-word, with a domain-specific meaning in a very specific context. In this paper we propose an approach based on a linguistic analysis of the corpus using a knowledge graph to learn representations that can unambiguously capture such terms and their meaning. We learn embeddings from different linguistic annotations on the text and evaluate them through a classification task over the SciGraph taxonomy, showing that our representations outperform (sub)word-level approaches.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces the National Centre for Text Mining University of Manchester systems submitted in CL-SciSumm 2019 Shared Task at BIRNDL 2019 Workshop. CL-SciSumm shared tasks focus on the identification of cited passages across scientific publications, and the subsequent summarisation of scientific articles based on their cited extracts. More specifically Task 1A is directed at the identification of cited text spans in the reference paper, based on the provided citation passages, while Task 1B concerns the classification of the citation passages based on their function in the text. For Task 2, the identified cited text spans are used in order to generate an informed summary for the reference paper. We participated in both tasks described above. We looked into supervised and semi-supervised approaches and explored the potential of adapting bidirectional transformers for each task. We further formalised Task 1A as a similarity ranking problem and implemented bilateral multi-perspective matching for natural language sentences.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a multi-task setup of identifying entities, relations, and coreference clusters in scientific articles. We create SciERC, a dataset that includes annotations for all three tasks and develop a unified framework called SciIE with shared span representations. The multi-task setup reduces cascading errors between tasks and leverages cross-sentence relations through coreference links. Experiments show that our multi-task model outperforms previous models in scientific information extraction without using any domain-specific features. We further show that the framework supports construction of a scientific knowledge graph, which we use to analyze information in scientific literature.",

    "abstract": "Ontology alignment is the task of identifying semantically equivalent entities from two given ontologies. Different ontologies have different representations of the same entity, resulting in a need to de-duplicate entities when merging ontologies. We propose a method for enriching entities in an ontology with external definition and context information, and use this additional information for ontology alignment. We develop a neural architecture capable of encoding the additional information when available, and show that the addition of external data results in an F1-score of 0.69 on the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) largebio SNOMED-NCI subtask, comparable with the entity-level matchers in a SOTA system.",

The purpose of this paper is to formalize this intuitive understanding, explore which research tasks of scientists can be attributed to research search, what approaches exist to solve a research search problem in general, and how they are implemented in specialized search engines for scientists. We researched existing works regarding information seeking behavior of scientists and the special variant of a search called exploratory search. There are several types of search typical for scientists, and we showed that most of them are exploratory. Exploratory search is different to information retrieval and demands special support from search systems. We analyzed seventeen actual search systems for academicians (from Google Scholar, Scopus and Web of Science to ResearchGate) from the exploratory search support aspect. We found that most of them didn\u2019t go far from simple information retrieval and there is a room for further improvements especially in the collaborative search support.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of information technology, the era of Big Data has come. Big Data technology has brought great opportunities for the research of technology mining, while the \"data dizzy\" and \"data redundancy\" effects brought by it cannot be ignored. As one of the basic methods of technology mining, the research of scientometrics also faces the same opportunities and challenges. In order to meet the challenges, an in-depth analysis of scientometrics was conducted. By using the papers of Scientometrics in SpringLinker Database from 1978 to 2017, a Full-Text citation analysis based on semantic technology is used to quantitatively assess the basic status, landscapes, hotspots and future development trends of the \u201cScientometrics\u201d research area. Besides traditional methods such as co-word analysis, main path analysis and sleeping beauty paper recognization, novel methods such as dynamic topic model and word vectors models are used, furthermore a three-dimensional visualization technology was proposed. It shows that these methods can provide a dynamic view of the evolution of scientometrics research landscapes, hotspots and trends from various perspectives which may serve as a potential guide for future research.",

    "abstract": "Computational manipulation of knowledge is an important, and often under-appreciated, aspect of biomedical Data Science. The first Data Science initiative from the US National Institutes of Health was entitled \u201cBig Data to Knowledge (BD2K).\u201d The main emphasis of the more than $200M allocated to that program has been on \u201cBig Data;\u201d the \u201cKnowledge\u201d component has largely been the implicit assumption that the work will lead to new biomedical knowledge. However, there is long-standing and highly productive work in computational knowledge representation and reasoning, and computational processing of knowledge has a role in the world of Data Science. Knowledge-based biomedical Data Science involves the design and implementation of computer systems that act as if they knew about biomedicine. There are many ways in which a computational approach might act as if it knew something: for example, it might be able to answer a natural language question about a biomedical topic, or pass an exam; it might be able to use existing biomedical knowledge to rank or evaluate hypotheses; it might explain or interpret data in light of prior knowledge, either in a Bayesian or other sort of framework. These are all examples of automated reasoning that act on computational representations of knowledge. After a brief survey of existing approaches to knowledge-based data science, this position paper argues that such research is ripe for expansion, and expanded application.",

    "abstract": "PurposeThe COVID-19 pandemic has sparked a remarkable volume of research literature, and scientists are increasingly in need of intelligent tools to cut through the noise and uncover relevant research directions. As a response, the authors propose a novel framework. In this framework, the authors develop a novel weighted semantic graph model to compress the research studies efficiently. Also, the authors present two analyses on this graph to propose alternative ways to uncover additional aspects of COVID-19 research.Design/methodology/approachThe authors construct the semantic graph using state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) techniques on COVID-19 publication texts (>100,000 texts). Next, the authors conduct an evolutionary analysis to capture the changes in COVID-19 research across time. Finally, the authors apply a link prediction study to detect novel COVID-19 research directions that are so far undiscovered.FindingsFindings reveal the success of the semantic graph in capturing scientific knowledge and its evolution. Meanwhile, the prediction experiments provide 79% accuracy on returning intelligible links, showing the reliability of the methods for predicting novel connections that could help scientists discover potential new directions.Originality/valueTo the authors\u2019 knowledge, this is the first study to propose a holistic framework that includes encoding the scientific knowledge in a semantic graph, demonstrates an evolutionary examination of past and ongoing research and offers scientists with tools to generate new hypotheses and research directions through predictive modeling and deep machine learning techniques.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a new method for temporal pattern analysis of scientific collaboration networks. We investigate in particular virus research activities through five epidemic or pandemic outbreaks in the recent two decades and in the ongoing pandemic with COVID-19. Our method embodies two innovative components. The first is a simple model of temporal collaboration networks with time segmented in publication time and convolved in citation history, to effectively capture and accommodate collaboration activities at mixed time scales. The second component is the novel use of graphlets to encode topological structures and to detect change and persistence in collaboration activities over time. We discover in particular two unique and universal roles of bi-fork graphlet in (1) identifying bridges among triangle clusters and (2) quantifying grassroots as the backbone of every collaboration network. We present a number of intriguing patterns and findings about the virus-research activities.",

Based on surveying graduate and undergraduate research students, it was found that getting started with research is a huge undertaking and requires constant guidance of immediate peers and professors. To address these issues, a collaborative online research tool was designed to help young researchers understand concepts on the fly. To understand whether the tool helps achieving the desired goal, usability studies were conducted to understand the usability and functionality issues of the tool. It was found that collaboration using annotations was extremely beneficial for users which were in line with our findings from the requirement phase. Additionally, it was noted that users appreciated the online reader and were open to trying it from the existing pdf solutions. However, many users noted several additional features that would be necessary to make this product useful. Future work involves improving the prototype and integration of the OpenReview APIs for large scale deployment. Our final prototype can be found on http://researchexchange.cs.umass.edu:3000/.",

    "abstract": "Combining Graph neural networks (GNNs) with contrastive learning for anomaly detection has drawn rising attention recently. Existing graph contrastive anomaly detection (GCAD) methods have primarily focused on improving detection capability through graph augmentation and multi-scale contrast modules. However, the underlying mechanisms of how these modules work have not been fully explored. We dive into the multi-scale and graph augmentation mechanism and observed that multi-scale contrast modules do not enhance the expression, while the multi-GNN modules are the hidden contributors. Previous studies have tended to attribute the benefits brought by multi-GNN to the multi-scale modules. In the paper, we delve into the misconception and propose Multi-GNN and Augmented Graph contrastive framework MAG, which unified the existing GCAD methods in the contrastive self-supervised perspective. We extracted two variants from the MAG framework, L-MAG and M-MAG. The L-MAG is the lightweight instance of the MAG, which outperform the state-of-the-art on Cora and Pubmed with the low computational cost. The variant M-MAG equipped with multi-GNN modules further improve the detection performance. Our study sheds light on the drawback of the existing GCAD methods and demonstrates the potential of multi-GNN and graph augmentation modules. Our code is available at https://github.com/liuyishoua/MAG-Framework.",

    "abstract": "In this research, the system was designed to solve problems related to High Availability on FDS (Fraud Detection System) servers that cannot be loaded balanced using the Round Robin method, resulting in changes to ISO 8583 messages. As a result, a method that can be used as High availability to maintain the Availability of the FDS Server without changing the message received is required. High availability will be achieved through the Active Passive Failover method, which will transfer data flows in the event of an operational failure on the FDS server. The transfer is based on CPU Load parameters and ISO 8583 messages, which are checked at each stage. The waterfall method was used in this research. The waterfall is a straightforward classic model with a linear system flow, with the output of each stage serving as the input for the next. The primary goals of this research are to ensure that data in ISO 8583 format can be streamed without changing messages, to measure the effectiveness of the Active Passive Failover method in performing High availability using ISO 8583 message parameters and CPU Load, and to increase the level of Availability and reliability of the FDS Server. This research's error rate decreased by 0.83%, and the SLA (Service Level Agreement) increased from 99.13% to 99.96%.",

    "abstract": "National Payment Switches (NPSs) and International Payment Switches (IPSs), including major players such as SWIFT, Mastercard, and CHIPS, have become vital to the financial infrastructure, facilitating secure and efficient transactions among local financial institutions. Nonetheless, the growing adoption of digital payments has heightened the risk of financial fraud. Consequently, NPSs, under the direct ownership of Central Banks (CBs), are increasingly adopting advanced technologies, such as cognitive computing, to bolster their fraud detection capabilities in their respective countries. This article delves into the role of cognitive computing in detecting financial fraud within NPSs. It examines the advantages of cognitive computing in recognising patterns of fraudulent behaviour and analysing vast amounts of data. Additionally, the study highlights the importance of focusing on how cognitive computing can augment traditional fraud detection methods, such as rule-based systems and data analytics. Nineteen real-world cases from eighteen countries are analysed, exploring the cognitive computing tools employed by NPSs to identify fraudulent transactions. The challenges and limitations of implementing cognitive computing in fraud detection and potential solutions to address these issues are identified. The primary assumption that cognitive computing is crucial for detecting financial fraud in NPSs is substantiated. Its ability to analyse large datasets and pinpoint patterns of fraudulent behaviour proves invaluable for financial institutions seeking to protect themselves against financial fraud in a progressively digital world. The conclusions drawn from the overview of the cases aim to identify best practices, potentially trigger new benchmarking standards, and facilitate the development of integrated cross-border solutions to combat financial fraud on a global scale effectively. The purpose of this research is to examine the role of cognitive computing in detecting financial fraud within NPSs, identify its advantages, challenges and limitations, and provide real-world case examples.",

    "abstract": "The explosive growth of cyber attacks nowadays, such as malware, spam, and intrusions, caused severe consequences on society. Securing cyberspace has become an utmost concern for organizations and governments. Traditional Machine Learning (ML) based methods are extensively used in detecting cyber threats, but they hardly model the correlations between real-world cyber entities. In recent years, with the proliferation of graph mining techniques, many researchers investigated these techniques for capturing correlations between cyber entities and achieving high performance. It is imperative to summarize existing graph-based cybersecurity solutions to provide a guide for future studies. Therefore, as a key contribution of this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of graph mining for cybersecurity, including an overview of cybersecurity tasks, the typical graph mining techniques, and the general process of applying them to cybersecurity, as well as various solutions for different cybersecurity tasks. For each task, we probe into relevant methods and highlight the graph types, graph approaches, and task levels in their modeling. Furthermore, we collect open datasets and toolkits for graph-based cybersecurity. Finally, we outlook the potential directions of this field for future research.",

    "title": "GAT-COBO: Cost-Sensitive Graph Neural Network for Telecom Fraud Detection",
    "abstract": "Along with the rapid evolution of mobile communication technologies, such as 5G, there has been a drastically increase in telecom fraud, which significantly dissipates individual fortune and social wealth. In recent years, graph mining techniques are gradually becoming a mainstream solution for detecting telecom fraud. However, the graph imbalance problem, caused by the Pareto principle, brings severe challenges to graph data mining. This is a new and challenging problem, but little previous work has been noticed. In this paper, we propose a Graph ATtention network with COst-sensitive BOosting (GAT-COBO) for the graph imbalance problem. First, we design a GAT-based base classifier to learn the embeddings of all nodes in the graph. Then, we feed the embeddings into a well-designed cost-sensitive learner for imbalanced learning. Next, we update the weights according to the misclassification cost to make the model focus more on the minority class. Finally, we sum the node embeddings obtained by multiple cost-sensitive learners to obtain a comprehensive node representation, which is used for the downstream anomaly detection task. Extensive experiments on two real-world telecom fraud detection datasets demonstrate that our proposed method is effective for the graph imbalance problem, outperforming the state-of-the-art GNNs and GNN-based fraud detectors. In addition, our model is also helpful for solving the widespread over-smoothing problem in GNNs. The GAT-COBO code and datasets are available at https://github.com/xxhu94/GAT-COBO.",

    "abstract": "Assuring that cell therapy products are safe before releasing them for use in patients is critical. Currently, compendial sterility testing for bacteria and fungi can take 7-14 days. The goal of this work was to develop a rapid untargeted approach for the sensitive detection of microbial contaminants at low abundance from low volume samples during the manufacturing process of cell therapies. We developed a long-read sequencing methodology using Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION platform with 16S and 18S amplicon sequencing to detect USP<71> organisms and other microbial species. Reads are classified metagenomically to predict the microbial species. We used an extreme gradient boosting machine learning algorithm (XGBoost) to first assess if a sample is contaminated and second, determine whether the predicted contaminant is correctly classified or misclassified. The model was used to make a final decision on the sterility status of the input sample. An optimised experimental and bioinformatics pipeline starting from spiked species through to sequenced reads allowed for the detection of microbial samples at 10 CFU / mL using metagenomic classification. Machine learning can be coupled with long read sequencing to detect and identify sample sterility status and microbial species present in T-cell cultures, including the USP<71> organisms to 10 CFU / mL. Importance This research presents a novel method for rapidly and accurately detecting microbial contaminants in cell therapy products, which is essential for ensuring patient safety. Traditional testing methods are time-consuming, taking 7-14 days, while our approach can significantly reduce this time. By combining advanced long read Nanopore sequencing techniques and machine learning, we can effectively identify the presence and types of microbial contaminants at low abundance levels. This breakthrough has the potential to improve the safety and efficiency of cell therapy manufacturing, leading to better patient outcomes and a more streamlined production process.",

    "title": "Neural Graph Reasoning: Complex Logical Query Answering Meets Graph Databases",
    "abstract": "Complex logical query answering (CLQA) is a recently emerged task of graph machine learning that goes beyond simple one-hop link prediction and solves a far more complex task of multi-hop logical reasoning over massive, potentially incomplete graphs in a latent space. The task received a significant traction in the community; numerous works expanded the field along theoretical and practical axes to tackle different types of complex queries and graph modalities with efficient systems. In this paper, we provide a holistic survey of CLQA with a detailed taxonomy studying the field from multiple angles, including graph types (modality, reasoning domain, background semantics), modeling aspects (encoder, processor, decoder), supported queries (operators, patterns, projected variables), datasets, evaluation metrics, and applications. Refining the CLQA task, we introduce the concept of Neural Graph Databases (NGDBs). Extending the idea of graph databases (graph DBs), NGDB consists of a Neural Graph Storage and a Neural Graph Engine. Inside Neural Graph Storage, we design a graph store, a feature store, and further embed information in a latent embedding store using an encoder. Given a query, Neural Query Engine learns how to perform query planning and execution in order to efficiently retrieve the correct results by interacting with the Neural Graph Storage. Compared with traditional graph DBs, NGDBs allow for a flexible and unified modeling of features in diverse modalities using the embedding store. Moreover, when the graph is incomplete, they can provide robust retrieval of answers which a normal graph DB cannot recover. Finally, we point out promising directions, unsolved problems and applications of NGDB for future research.",

    "abstract": "Graph machine learning and fraud detection systems are growing and popular today. Fraud detection systems have been widely used as a tool to detect potentially fraudulent transactions. Fraud detection systems can be used to determine patterns of transactions that are suspected of being criminal transactions. Graph machine learning development can be implemented in anything that can be represented in graph form. The banking fraud detection system can be implemented in graph form by connecting customers who have made transactions with other customers or customer transactional activities. From the graph that has been formed, predictions will be made so that new transactions can be classified as fraudulent transactions or not by connecting these transactions with the graphs that have been made. The experimental results show that the graph-based fraud detection model produces better performance than the tree-based fraud detection model, but with a longer inference time.",

    "abstract": "Transformers have become the de facto models of choice in machine learning, typically leading to impressive performance on many applications. At the same time, the architectural development in the transformer world is mostly driven by empirical findings, and the theoretical understanding of their architectural building blocks is rather limited. In contrast, Dense Associative Memory models or Modern Hopfield Networks have a well-established theoretical foundation, but have not yet demonstrated truly impressive practical results. We propose a transformer architecture that replaces the sequence of feedforward transformer blocks with a single large Associative Memory model. Our novel architecture, called Energy Transformer (or ET for short), has many of the familiar architectural primitives that are often used in the current generation of transformers. However, it is not identical to the existing architectures. The sequence of transformer layers in ET is purposely designed to minimize a specifically engineered energy function, which is responsible for representing the relationships between the tokens. As a consequence of this computational principle, the attention in ET is different from the conventional attention mechanism. In this work, we introduce the theoretical foundations of ET, explore it's empirical capabilities using the image completion task, and obtain strong quantitative results on the graph anomaly detection task.",

    "abstract": "The fraud problem has drastically increased with the rapid growth of online lending. Since loan applications, approvals and disbursements are operated online, deceptive borrowers are prone to conceal or falsify information to maliciously obtain loans, while lenders have difficulty in identifying fraud without direct contacts and lack binding force on customers\u2019 loan performance, which results in the frequent occurrence of fraud events. Therefore, it is significant for financial institutions to apply valuable data and competitive technologies for fraud detection to reduce financial losses from loan scams. This paper combines the advantages of statistical methods and ensemble learning algorithms to design the grouped trees and weighted ensemble algorithm (GTWE), and establishes fraud prediction models for online loans based on mobile application usage behaviors(App behaviors) by logistic regression, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), long short-term memory (LSTM) and the GTWE algorithm, respectively. The experimental results show that the fraud prediction model based on the GTWE algorithm achieves outstanding classification effect and stability with satisfactory interpretability. Meanwhile, the fraud probability of customers detected by the fraud prediction model is as high as 84.19%, which indicates that App behaviors have a considerable impact on predicting fraud in online loan application.",

    "abstract": "Vulnerability in banking systems has exposed us to fraudulent acts, which cause severe damage to both customers and the bank in terms of loss of money and reputation. Financial fraud in banks is estimated to result in a significant amount of financial loss annually. Early detection of this helps to mitigate the fraud, by developing a counter strategy and recovering from such losses. A machine learning-based approach is proposed in this paper to contribute to fraud detection successfully. The artificial intelligence (AI) based model will speed up the check verification to counteract the counterfeits and lower the damage. In this paper, we analyzed numerous intelligent algorithms trained on a public dataset to find the correlation of certain factors with fraudulence. The dataset utilized for this research is resampled to minimize the high class of imbalance in it and analyzed the data using the proposed algorithm for better accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Anomalies are a set of samples that do not follow the normal behavior of the majority of data. In an industrial dataset, anomalies appear in a very small number of samples. Currently, deep learning-based models have achieved important advances in image anomaly detection. However, with general models, real-world application data consisting of non-ideal images, also known as poison images, become a challenge. When the work environment is not conducive to consistently acquiring a good or ideal sample, an additional adaptive learning model is needed. In this work, we design a potential methodology to tackle poison or non-ideal images that commonly appear in industrial production lines by enhancing the existing training data. We propose Hierarchical Image Transformation and Multi-level Features (HIT-MiLF) modules for an anomaly detection network to adapt to perturbances from novelties in testing images. This approach provides a hierarchical process for image transformation during pre-processing and explores the most efficient layer of extracted features from a CNN backbone. The model generates new transformations of training samples that simulate the non-ideal condition and learn the normality in high-dimensional features before applying a Gaussian mixture model to detect the anomalies from new data that it has never seen before. Our experimental results show that hierarchical transformation and multi-level feature exploration improve the baseline performance on industrial metal datasets.",

    "abstract": "Telecom fraud detection is of great significance in online social networks. Yet the massive, redundant, incomplete, and uncertain network information makes it a challenging task to handle. Hence, this paper mainly uses the correlation of attributes by entropy function to optimize the data quality and then solves the problem of telecommunication fraud detection with incomplete information. First, to filter out redundancy and noise, we propose an attribute reduction algorithm based on max-correlation and max-independence rate (MCIR) to improve data quality. Then, we design a rough-gain anomaly detection algorithm (MCIR-RGAD) using the idea of maximal consistent blocks to deal with missing incomplete data. Finally, the experimental results on authentic telecommunication fraud data and UCI data show that the MCIR-RGAD algorithm provides an effective solution for reducing the computation time, improving the data quality, and processing incomplete data.",

    "abstract": "Using a quantum processor to embed and process classical data enables the generation of correlations between variables that are inefficient to represent through classical computation. A fundamental question is whether these correlations could be harnessed to enhance learning performances on real datasets. Here, we report the use of a neutral atom quantum processor comprising up to $32$ qubits to implement machine learning tasks on graph-structured data. To that end, we introduce a quantum feature map to encode the information about graphs in the parameters of a tunable Hamiltonian acting on an array of qubits. Using this tool, we first show that interactions in the quantum system can be used to distinguish non-isomorphic graphs that are locally equivalent. We then realize a toxicity screening experiment, consisting of a binary classification protocol on a biochemistry dataset comprising $286$ molecules of sizes ranging from $2$ to $32$ nodes, and obtain results which are comparable to those using the best classical kernels. Using techniques to compare the geometry of the feature spaces associated with kernel methods, we then show evidence that the quantum feature map perceives data in an original way, which is hard to replicate using classical kernels.",

However, the increasingly widespread adoption of graph analytics comes with a commensurate increase in the need to protect private information in graph data, especially in light of the many privacy breaches in real-world graph data that were supposed to preserve sensitive information. This article provides a comprehensive survey of private graph data release algorithms that seek to achieve the fine balance between privacy and utility, with a specific focus on provably private mechanisms. Many of these mechanisms are natural extensions of the Differential Privacy framework to graph data, but we also investigate more general privacy formulations like Pufferfish Privacy that address some of the limitations of Differential Privacy. We also provide a wide-ranging survey of the applications of private graph data release mechanisms to social networks, finance, supply chain, and health care. This article should benefit practitioners and researchers alike in the increasingly important area of private analytics and data release.",

    "abstract": "Vulnerability assessment in industrial IoT networks is critical due to the evolving nature of the domain and the increasing complexity of security threats. This study aims to address the existing gaps in the literature by conducting a comprehensive survey on the use of attack graphs for vulnerability assessment in IoT networks. Attack graphs serve as a valuable cybersecurity tool for modeling and analyzing potential attack scenarios on systems, networks, or applications. The survey covers the research conducted between 2016 and 2021(34 peer-reviewed journal articles and 28 conference papers), identifying and categorizing the main methodologies and technologies employed in generating and analyzing attack graphs. In this review, core modeling techniques for IoT vulnerability assessment are highlighted, such as Markov Decision Processes (MDP), Feature Pyramid Networks (FPN), K-means clustering, and logistic regression models, along with other techniques involving genetic algorithms like fast-forward (FF), contingent fast-forwards (CFF), advanced reinforcement-learning algorithms, and HARMs models. The evaluation of the performance of these attack graph models using IoT networks or devices as case studies is also emphasized. This survey provides valuable insights into the state-of-the-art attack graph techniques for IoT network vulnerability assessment, identifying various applications, performances, research opportunities, and challenges. As a reference source, it serves to inform academicians and practitioners interested in leveraging attack graphs for IoT network vulnerability assessment and guides future research directions in this area.",

    "abstract": "We consider differentially private range queries on a graph where query ranges are defined as the set of edges on a shortest path of the graph. Edges in the graph carry sensitive attributes and the goal is to report the sum of these attributes on a shortest path for counting query or the minimum of the attributes in a bottleneck query. We use differential privacy to ensure that the release of these query answers provide protection of the privacy of the sensitive edge attributes. Our goal is to develop mechanisms that minimize the additive error of the reported answers with the given privacy budget. In this paper we report non-trivial results for private range queries on shortest paths. For counting range queries we can achieve an additive error of $\\tilde O(n^{1/3})$ for $\\varepsilon$-DP and $\\tilde O(n^{1/4})$ for $(\\varepsilon, \\delta)$-DP. We present two algorithms where we control the final error by carefully balancing perturbation added to the edge attributes directly versus perturbation added to a subset of range query answers (which can be used for other range queries). Bottleneck range queries are easier and can be answered with polylogarithmic additive errors using standard techniques.",

    "abstract": "Online transactions, medical services, financial transactions, and banking all have their share of fraudulent activity. The annual revenue generated by fraud exceeds $1 trillion. Even while fraud is dangerous for organizations, it may be uncovered with the help of intelligent solutions such as rules engines and machine learning. In this research, we introduce a unique hybrid technique for identifying financial payment fraud by combining nature-inspired-based Hyperparameter tuning with several supervised classifier models, as implemented in a modified version of the XGBoost Algorithm. At the outset, we split out a sample of the full financial payment dataset to use as a test set. We use 70% of the data for training and 30% for testing. Records that are known to be illegitimate or fraudulent are predicted, while those that raise suspicion are further investigated using a number of machine learning algorithms. The models are trained and validated using the 10-fold cross-validation technique. Several tests using a dataset of actual financial transactions are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

Frequentist A/B testing identified fraud in bounce rate at 5% significance, and bounces at 10% significance, but was unable to ascertain fraud at the standard significance cutoffs for scientific studies.Research limitations/implicationsNone within the scope of the research plan.Practical implicationsBayesian A/B tests of the data not only yielded a clear delineation of the timing and impact of the IP fraud, but calculated the loss of sales dollars, traffic and time on the firm\u2019s website, with precise confidence limits.Social implicationsBayesian A/B testing can derive economically meaningful statistics, whereas frequentist A/B testing only provide p-value\u2019s whose meaning may be hard to grasp, and where misuse is widespread and has been a major topic in metascience. While misuse of p-values in scholarly articles may simply be grist for academic debate, the uncertainty surrounding the meaning of p-values in business analytics actually can cost firms money.Originality/valueThere is very little empirical research in e-commerce that uses Bayesian A/B testing. Almost all corporate testing is done via frequentist Neyman-Pearson methods.",

    "abstract": "Due to the rich relational information of graph-structured data, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely used for fraud detection tasks, where the suspiciousness of nodes is identified by aggregating information about the neighbors of different relations. To bypass such detection, fraudsters camouflage themselves by providing seemingly legitimate feedback (i.e., feature camouflage) or connecting many legitimate users (i.e., relation camouflage). Moreover, when the label distribution of nodes is severely skewed, GNN-based algorithms may have limitations. To counteract the effect of disguised fraudsters under imbalanced graphs on fraud detection, we propose a cascaded GNN fraud detector with dual features (CGDF-GNN) in this paper. It tackles the impact of feature camouflage by applying a dual-feature parallel aggregation method and uses a cascaded neighbor aggregator to deal with the single-level learning problem arising from relational camouflage. Experiments on graph-based fraud detection tasks on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model compared to current state-of-the-art baselines.",

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as the leading paradigm for solving graph analytical problems in various real-world applications. Nevertheless, GNNs could potentially render biased predictions towards certain demographic subgroups. Understanding how the bias in predictions arises is critical, as it guides the design of GNN debiasing mechanisms. However, most existing works overwhelmingly focus on GNN debiasing, but fall short on explaining how such bias is in-duced. In this paper, we study a novel problem of interpreting GNN unfairness through attributing it to the in\ufb02uence of training nodes. Speci\ufb01cally, we propose a novel strategy named Probabilistic Distribution Disparity (PDD) to measure the bias exhibited in GNNs, and develop an algorithm to ef\ufb01ciently estimate the in\ufb02uence of each training node on such bias. We verify the validity of PDD and the effectiveness of in\ufb02uence estimation through experiments on real-world datasets. Finally, we also demonstrate how the proposed framework could be used for debiasing GNNs. Open-source code can be found at https://github.com/yushundong/BIND.",

    "title": "Collusive anomalies detection based on collaborative markov random field",
    "abstract": "Abnormal collusive behavior, widely existing in various fields with concealment and synergy, is particularly harmful in user-generated online reviews and hard to detect by traditional methods. With the development of network science, this problem can be solved by analyzing structure features. As a graph-based anomaly detection method, the Markov random field (MRF)-based model has been widely used to identify the collusive anomalies and shown its effectiveness. However, existing methods are mostly unable to highlight the primary synergy relationship among nodes and consider much irrelevant information, which caused poor detectability. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel MRF-based method (ACEagle), considering node-level and community-level behavior features. Our method has several advantages: (1) based on the analysis of the nodes\u2019 local structure, the community-level behavioral features are combined to calculate the nodes\u2019 prior probability to close the ground truth, (2) it measured the behavior\u2019s collaborative intensity between nodes by time and weight, constructing MRF by the synergic relationship exceeding the threshold to filter irrelevant structural information, (3) it operates in a completely unsupervised fashion requiring no labeled data, while still incorporating side information if available. Through experiments in user-reviewed datasets where abnormal collusive behavior is most typical, the results show that ACEagle is significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in collusive anomalies detection.",

Particularly the fraudulent patterns closer to the class boundary get missed by the model. This paper proposes using GANs to simulate fraud transaction patterns conditioned on genuine transactions, thereby enabling the model to learn a translation function between both spaces. Further to synthesize fraudulent samples from the class boundary, we trained GANs using losses inspired by data poisoning attack literature and discussed their efficacy in improving fraud detection classifier performance.

    "title": "Financial Fraud Detection Based on Machine Learning: A Systematic Literature Review",
    "abstract": "Financial fraud, considered as deceptive tactics for gaining financial benefits, has recently become a widespread menace in companies and organizations. Conventional techniques such as manual verifications and inspections are imprecise, costly, and time consuming for identifying such fraudulent activities. With the advent of artificial intelligence, machine-learning-based approaches can be used intelligently to detect fraudulent transactions by analyzing a large number of financial data. Therefore, this paper attempts to present a systematic literature review (SLR) that systematically reviews and synthesizes the existing literature on machine learning (ML)-based fraud detection. Particularly, the review employed the Kitchenham approach, which uses well-defined protocols to extract and synthesize the relevant articles; it then report the obtained results. Based on the specified search strategies from popular electronic database libraries, several studies have been gathered. After inclusion/exclusion criteria, 93 articles were chosen, synthesized, and analyzed. The review summarizes popular ML techniques used for fraud detection, the most popular fraud type, and evaluation metrics. The reviewed articles showed that support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN) are popular ML algorithms used for fraud detection, and credit card fraud is the most popular fraud type addressed using ML techniques. The paper finally presents main issues, gaps, and limitations in financial fraud detection areas and suggests possible areas for future research.",

    "abstract": "\n This study proposes a novel anomaly detection approach focusing on structural components which do not have a baseline model and with complex boundary conditions that cannot be built into a finite element or a digital twin model. The approach uses only sensor collected compressed response distribution data to detect and localize changes in boundary conditions under extreme loading events. The developed methods use unsupervised anomaly detection networks combined with novel data compression algorithms. The deep network collects training data from real direct measured responses of the structural system over time to build a model and then computes the reconstruction errors and identifies anomalies. A simplified gusset plate under variable clamped-clamped boundary conditions is used in this study as preliminary proof-of-concept. In this work, anomalies are induced by changing the connection conditions (boundary conditions) of the gusset plate (e.g. bolts loosening). This study improved the deep learning network performance by incorporating mechanics-based loss functions into the network, fed with experimental data obtained from the distributed sensors installed on the structural element. Results show that the mechanics-based modified loss function significantly improves the identification and localization abilities of boundary condition anomalies and eliminates undesired factors and false predictions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In our paper, we have proposed to use graphs to detect anomaly in human action video. Although the detection of anomaly is a widely researched topic, but very few researchers have detected anomaly in action video using graphs. in our proposed method we have represented the smaller section (sub-section) of our input video as a graph where vertices of the graph are the space time interest points in the sub-section video and the association between the space time interest points exists. Thus, graphs for each sub section are created to look for a repeated substructure. We believe most of the actions inherently are repeated in nature. Thus, we have tried to capture the repetitive sub-structure of the action represented as a graph and used this repetitive sub-structure to compress the graph. If the compressed graph has few elements that have not been compressed, we suspect them as anomaly. But the threshold value takes care not to make the proposed method very much sensitive towards the few uncompressed elements. Our proposed method has been implemented on locally created \u201cextended KTH\u201d and \u201cextended Weizmann\u201d datasets with good accuracy score. The proposed method can also be extended for few more applications such as training athletes and taking elderly care.",

    "abstract": "In modern market economy, corporate financial frauds emerge one after another, which have a huge impact on the stock market and triggered an unprecedented credit crisis. Therefore, it is particularly important to identify financial frauds. Improving the efficiency, accuracy, and coverage of fraud identification in financial reports through digital and intelligent means is one of the important links to improve credit risk control of securities companies and also for securities companies to accurately price related financial products of target companies. Traditional recognition methods based on artificial rules can cover relatively limited indicators; rule parameters are set randomly. Besides, it is difficult to make rules based on high-dimension indicators and to dig the hidden deep relationships between indicators. This paper summarizes the relevant indicators of financial fraud identification from the perspective of financial and nonfinancial characteristics. Then, the identification and early warning of financial fraud risk based on bidirectional long-short term memory model are proposed. This method uses the idea of ensemble learning, weights the probability of financial key indicators, and uses the optimal transfer probability to solve the financial fraud risk results. The results show that the industry-specific modeling can significantly improve the accuracy of the financial fraud identification model and it also can effectively help the government regulatory departments, investors, and audit departments to correctly identify the financial fraud of listed companies.",

    "abstract": "Fake reviews have become prevalent on various social networks such as e-commerce and social media platforms. As fake reviews cause a heavily negative influence on the public, timely detection and response are of great significance. To this end, effective fake review detection has become an emerging research area that attracts increasing attention from various disciplines like network science, computational social science, and data science. An important line of research in fake review detection is to utilize graph learning methods, which incorporate both the attribute features of reviews and their relationships into the detection process. To further compare these graph learning methods in this paper, we conduct a detailed survey on fake review detection. The survey presents a comprehensive taxonomy and covers advancements in three high-level categories, including fake review detection, fake reviewer detection, and fake review analysis. Different kinds of fake reviews and their corresponding examples are also summarized. Furthermore, we discuss the graph learning methods, including supervised and unsupervised learning approaches for fake review detection. Specifically, we outline the unsupervised learning approach that includes generation-based and contrast-based methods, respectively. In view of the existing problems in the current methods and data, we further discuss some challenges and open issues in this field, including the imperfect data, explainability, model efficiency, and lightweight models.",

    "abstract": "Anomaly detection is an important problem for complex distributed systems consisting of hardware and software components. A thorough understanding of the requirements and challenges of anomaly detection for such systems is pivotal to the security of a system, especially for real-world deployment. While there have been many diverse research areas and application domains that deal with the problem, few have attempted to provide an in-depth look at such systems. Most anomaly detection techniques have been specifically developed for certain application domains, while others are more generic. In this survey, we explore the significant potential of graph-based algorithms to identify and mitigate different types of anomalies in complex distributed heterogeneous systems. Our main focus is to provide an in-depth look at graphs when applied on heterogeneous computing devices spread across complex distributed systems. This study analyzes, compares, and contrasts the state-of-the-art research articles in the field. First, we describe the characteristics of the real-world distributed systems and their specific challenges of anomaly detection in such complex networks, such as data and evaluation, nature of the anomalies, and real-world requirements. Later, we discuss why graphs can be leveraged in such systems and the benefits of utilizing graphs. Then we will aptly delve into the state-of-the-art approaches and highlight their strength and weaknesses. Finally, we evaluate and compare these approaches and point out the areas for possible improvements.",

    "abstract": "Unsupervised anomaly detection (AD) is a challenging task in realistic applications. Recently, there is an increasing trend to detect anomalies with deep neural networks (DNN). However, most popular deep AD detectors cannot protect the network from learning contaminated information brought by anomalous data, resulting in unsatisfactory detection performance and overfitting issues. In this work, we identify one reason that hinders most existing DNN-based anomaly detection methods from performing is the wide adoption of the Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM). ERM assumes that the performance of an algorithm on an unknown distribution can be approximated by averaging losses on the known training set. This averaging scheme thus ignores the distinctions between normal and anomalous instances. To break through the limitations of ERM, we propose a novel Diminishing Empirical Risk Minimization (DERM) framework. Specifically, DERM adaptively adjusts the impact of individual losses through a well-devised aggregation strategy. Theoretically, our proposed DERM can directly modify the gradient contribution of each individual loss in the optimization process to suppress the influence of outliers, leading to a robust anomaly detector. Empirically, DERM outperformed the state-of-the-art on the unsupervised AD benchmark consisting of 18 datasets.",

Objective This study aims to develop an online, lightweight unsupervised learning\u2013based approach to detect anomalies representing adverse health conditions using activity changes in people living with dementia. We demonstrated its effectiveness over state-of-the-art methods on a real-world data set of 9363 days collected from 15 participant households by the UK Dementia Research Institute between August 2019 and July 2021. Our approach was applied to household movement data to detect urinary tract infections (UTIs) and hospitalizations. Methods We propose and evaluate a solution based on Contextual Matrix Profile (CMP), an exact, ultrafast distance-based anomaly detection algorithm. Using daily aggregated household movement data collected via passive infrared sensors, we generated CMPs for location-wise sensor counts, duration, and change in hourly movement patterns for each patient. We computed a normalized anomaly score in 2 ways: by combining univariate CMPs and by developing a multidimensional CMP. The performance of our method was evaluated relative to Angle-Based Outlier Detection, Copula-Based Outlier Detection, and Lightweight Online Detector of Anomalies. We used the multidimensional CMP to discover and present the important features associated with adverse health conditions in people living with dementia. Results The multidimensional CMP yielded, on average, 84.3% recall with 32.1 alerts, or a 5.1% alert rate, offering the best balance of recall and relative precision compared with Copula-Based and Angle-Based Outlier Detection and Lightweight Online Detector of Anomalies when evaluated for UTI and hospitalization. Midnight to 6 AM bathroom activity was shown to be the most important cross-patient digital biomarker of anomalies indicative of UTI, contributing approximately 30% to the anomaly score. We also demonstrated how CMP-based anomaly scoring can be used for a cross-patient view of anomaly patterns. Conclusions To the best of our knowledge, this is the first real-world study to adapt the CMP to continuous anomaly detection in a health care scenario. The CMP inherits the speed, accuracy, and simplicity of the Matrix Profile, providing configurability, the ability to denoise and detect patterns, and explainability to clinical practitioners. We addressed the need for anomaly scoring in multivariate time series health care data by developing the multidimensional CMP. With high sensitivity, a low alert rate, better overall performance than state-of-the-art methods, and the ability to discover digital biomarkers of anomalies, the CMP is a clinically meaningful unsupervised anomaly detection technique extensible to multimodal data for dementia and other health care scenarios.",

    "abstract": "The most common method used to document monetary transactions in Brazil is by issuing electronic invoices (NF-e). The audit of electronic invoices is essential, and this can be improved by using data mining solutions, such as clustering and anomaly detection. However, applying these solutions is not a simple task because NF-e data contains millions of records with noisy fields and nonstandard documents, especially short text descriptions. In addition to these challenges, it is costly to extract information from short texts to identify traces of mismanagement, embezzlement, commercial fraud or tax evasion. Analyzing such data can be more effective when divided into well-defined groups. However, efficient solutions for clustering data with characteristics similar to NF-es have not yet been proposed in the literature. We developed ELINAC, a service for clustering short-text data in NF-es that uses an automatic encoder to cluster data. ELINAC aids in auditing transactions documented in NF-e, clustering similar data by short-text descriptions and making anomaly detection in numeric fields easier. For this, ELINAC explores how to model the automatic encoder without increasing the calculation costs to suppress a large number of short text data. In the worst case, the results show that ELINAC efficiently groups data while performing three times faster than solutions previously adopted in the literature.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Criminal networks continue to utilize the global financial system to launder their proceeds of crime, despite the broad enactment of anti-money laundering (aml) laws and regulations in many countries. Money laundering consumes capital resources and the tax revenue needed to fund infrastructure development and alleviate poverty in developing market economies. This paper, therefore, expands on the tools available for enabling privacy-preserving data mining in multi-dimensional datasets to combat cross-border money laundering. Most importantly, this paper develops a novel measure for detecting anomalies in cross-border financial networks, allowing financial institutions and regulatory organizations to identify suspicious nodes. The research used a sample dataset comprising international financial transactions and a hypothetical dataset to demonstrate the measure of node importance and the symmetric-key encryption algorithm. The results support the argument that the proposed network measure can detect node anomalies in the cross-border financial flows network, enabling regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies to investigate financial transactions for suspicious activity and criminal conduct. The encryption algorithm can ensure adherence to information privacy laws and policies without compromising data reusability. Hence, the proposed methodology can improve the proactive management of money laundering risks associated with cross-border fund flows for the global financial system\u2019s benefit.",

    "abstract": "Large graphs are often used to simulate and model complex systems in various research and application fields. Because of its importance, frequent subgraph mining (FSM) in single large graphs is a vital issue, and recently, it has attracted numerous researchers, and played an important role in various tasks for both research and application purposes. FSM is aimed at finding all subgraphs whose number of appearances in a large graph is greater than or equal to a given frequency threshold. In most recent applications, the underlying graphs are very large, such as social networks, and therefore algorithms for FSM from a single large graph have been rapidly developed, but all of them have NP\u2010hard (nondeterministic polynomial time) complexity with huge search spaces, and therefore still need a lot of time and memory to restore and process. In this article, we present an overview of problems of FSM, important phases in FSM, main groups of FSM, as well as surveying many modern applied algorithms. This includes many practical applications and is a fundamental premise for many studies in the future.",

    "abstract": "Argumentation-based dialogue models have shown to be appropriate for decision contexts in which it is intended to overcome the lack of interaction between decision-makers, either because they are dispersed, they are too many, or they are simply not even known. However, to support decision processes with argumentation-based dialogue models, it is necessary to have knowledge of certain aspects that are specific to each decision-maker, such as preferences, interests, and limitations, among others. Failure to obtain this knowledge could ruin the model\u2019s success. In this work, we sought to facilitate the information acquisition process by studying strategies to automatically predict the tourists\u2019 preferences (ratings) in relation to points of interest based on their reviews. We explored different Machine Learning methods to predict users\u2019 ratings. We used Natural Language Processing strategies to predict whether a review is positive or negative and the rating assigned by users on a scale of 1 to 5. We then applied supervised methods such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Recurrent Neural Networks to determine whether a tourist likes/dislikes a given point of interest. We also used a distinctive approach in this field through unsupervised techniques for anomaly detection problems. The goal was to improve the supervised model in identifying only those tourists who truly like or dislike a particular point of interest, in which the main objective is not to identify everyone, but fundamentally not to fail those who are identified in those conditions. The experiments carried out showed that the developed models could predict with high accuracy whether a review is positive or negative but have some difficulty in accurately predicting the rating assigned by users. Unsupervised method Local Outlier Factor improved the results, reducing Logistic Regression false positives with an associated cost of increasing false negatives.",

    "abstract": "Anomaly detection from graph data is an important data mining task in many applications such as social networks, finance, and e-commerce. Existing efforts in graph anomaly detection typically only consider the information in a single scale (view), thus inevitably limiting their capability in capturing anomalous patterns in complex graph data. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework, graph ANomaly dEtection framework with Multi-scale cONtrastive lEarning (ANEMONE in short). By using a graph neural network as a backbone to encode the information from multiple graph scales (views), we learn better representation for nodes in a graph. In maximizing the agreements between instances at both the patch and context levels concurrently, we estimate the anomaly score of each node with a statistical anomaly estimator according to the degree of agreement from multiple perspectives. To further exploit a handful of ground-truth anomalies (few-shot anomalies) that may be collected in real-life applications, we further propose an extended algorithm, ANEMONE-FS, to integrate valuable information in our method. We conduct extensive experiments under purely unsupervised settings and few-shot anomaly detection settings, and we demonstrate that the proposed method ANEMONE and its variant ANEMONE-FS consistently outperform state-of-the-art algorithms on six benchmark datasets.",

    "abstract": "The popularity and remarkable attractiveness of cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin, absorb countless enthusiasts every day. Although Blockchain technology prevents fraudulent behavior, it cannot detect fraud on its own. There are always unimaginable ways to commit fraud, and the need to use anomaly detection methods to identify abnormal and fraudulent behaviors has become a necessity. The main purpose of this study is to use the Blockchain technology of symmetry and asymmetry in computer and engineering science to present a new method for detecting anomalies in Bitcoin with more appropriate efficiency. In this study, a collective anomaly approach was used. Instead of detecting the anomaly of individual addresses and wallets, the anomaly of users was examined. In addition to using the collective anomaly detection method, the trimmed_Kmeans algorithm was used for clustering. The results of this study show the anomalies are more visible among users who had multiple wallets. The proposed method revealed 14 users who had committed fraud, including 26 addresses in 9 cases, whereas previous works detected a maximum of 7 addresses in 5 cases of fraud. The suggested approach, in addition to reducing the processing overhead for extracting features, detect more abnormal users and anomaly behavior.",

    "abstract": "Although the diagnosis and treatment of depression is a medical field, ICTs and AI technologies are used widely to detect depression earlier in the elderly. These technologies are used to identify behavioral changes in the physical world or sentiment changes in cyberspace, known as symptoms of depression. However, although sentiment and physical changes, which are signs of depression in the elderly, are usually revealed simultaneously, there is no research on them at the same time. To solve the problem, this paper proposes knowledge graph-based cyber\u2013physical view (CPV)-based activity pattern recognition for the early detection of depression, also known as KARE. In the KARE framework, the knowledge graph (KG) plays key roles in providing cross-domain knowledge as well as resolving issues of grammatical and semantic heterogeneity required in order to integrate cyberspace and the physical world. In addition, it can flexibly express the patterns of different activities for each elderly. To achieve this, the KARE framework implements a set of new machine learning techniques. The first is 1D-CNN for attribute representation in relation to learning to connect the attributes of physical and cyber worlds and the KG. The second is the entity alignment with embedding vectors extracted by the CNN and GNN. The third is a graph extraction method to construct the CPV from KG with the graph representation learning and wrapper-based feature selection in the unsupervised manner. The last one is a method of activity-pattern graph representation based on a Gaussian Mixture Model and KL divergence for training the GAT model to detect depression early. To demonstrate the superiority of the KARE framework, we performed the experiments using real-world datasets with five state-of-the-art models in knowledge graph entity alignment.",

    "abstract": "In network security, various protocols exist, but these cannot be said to be secure. Moreover, is not easy to train the end-users, and this process is time-consuming as well. It can be said this way, that it takes much time for an individual to become a good cybersecurity professional. Many hackers and illegal agents try to take advantage of the vulnerabilities through various incremental penetrations that can compromise the critical systems. The conventional tools available for this purpose are not enough to handle things as desired. Risks are always present, and with dynamically evolving networks, they are very likely to lead to serious incidents. This research work has proposed a model to visualize and predict cyber-attacks in complex, multilayered networks. The calculation will correspond to the cyber software vulnerabilities in the networks within the specific domain. All the available network security conditions and the possible places where an attacker can exploit the system are summarized.",

    "title": "A Heuristic Approach Using Template Miners for Error Prediction in Telecommunication Networks",
    "abstract": "With the appearance of large-scale systems, the size of the generated logs increased rapidly. Almost every software produces such files. Log files contain runtime information of the software, as well as indicate noteworthy events or suspicious behaviors like errors. To understand and monitor the operation of the system, log files are a valuable source of information, which can be used to predict upcoming anomalies. In recent years numerous techniques have been proposed for this purpose. There are supervised models like SVM or decision trees and also unsupervised ones like Isolation Forest, Log Clustering, or PCA. There are also methods that use deep learning, like Autoencoder, CNN, LSTM, or Transformer. Many of the above-mentioned methods take advantage of template miners, that extract the event types from the unstructured data. In our paper, we propose a method that uses these templates to predict upcoming anomalies. We use 80% of our data for training, and 20% for tests. First, we use half of the train data and sort the templates that have an occurrence that is followed by an error to create a list of candidate templates. In the second step, we use the other half, to check how often the ten upcoming lines after a candidate template actually contain an anomaly. If a given percentage is reached, we consider the template as an indicator for upcoming anomalies. We conduct various experiments to verify the capability of our method like measuring the precision, recall, f-score accuracy, and speed on various data sources. The proposed method slightly falls behind SVM and CNN with an average of 88.06% precision, 90.43% recall, and 89.11% f-score, however, it has better accuracy with 98.19%. In addition, our algorithm is two times faster than SVM and three and a half times faster than CNN.",

    "title": "Systematic Evaluation of CASH Search Strategies for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection",
    "abstract": "Anomaly detection is an important data mining task that aims to detect abnormal examples in a dataset. Dozens of unsupervised algorithms have been developed for this task, each of which can be finely controlled via multiple hyperparameters. Therefore, choosing an algorithm that works well for a new dataset has traditionally been a time-consuming trial-and-error process. Moreover, any ground-truth labels to guide this process are hard to come by in real-world anomaly detection problems. On the other hand, if we are able to collect a small, labeled validation set, we could leverage the AutoML paradigm to au-tomate this model search. While the off-the-shelf AutoML search strategies for combined algorithm selection and hyperparameter optimization (CASH) are effective for supervised classification and regression tasks, they require the availability of plenty of ground-truth labels and large validation sets. It is unclear whether CASH will be equally effective for anomaly detection problems where the validation sets are typically small at best and not always representative of the test set at worst. In this paper, we present a discussion and experimental evaluation of how the structure of the validation set, i.e., its size and label bias, impacts the performance of different CASH search strategies within the context of anomaly detection.",

We draw on 54 identified relevant machine learning-based fraud detection systems to address this research gap and develop a taxonomic scheme. By deriving three archetypes of machine learning-based fraud detection systems, the taxonomy paves the way for research and practice to understand and advance fraud detection knowledge to combat fraud and abuse.",

Although we have a labeled real dataset, our target is not only to obtain relevant results on it, but also on random graphs in which typical anomaly patterns have been injected. So, we want simultaneously adequacy to the real data and robustness. Our method is based on designing new features; the most important are those resulting from the reduced egonet, which is the subgraph that remains from an egonet after eliminating the nodes connected with a single edge to the center; another feature is built by appealing to random walks and serves as indicator of circular flows. Our features are added to usual egonet features and a general anomaly detection algorithm, in our case Isolation Forest, serves to detect the anomalies. Experiments on the real data and a comprehensive set of synthetic data show that our approach is adequate, robust and better than some previous methods.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a new method named evolving-graph generation framework to simultaneously solve the complexity and dynamic nature of the attribute networks that can occur in graph-based anomaly detection with Graph Neural Networks (GNN). The proposed framework consists of two components. The \ufb01rst component is a feature selection method that hybridizes \ufb01lter-based and wrapper-based techniques to reduce the snapshots. The second component is an association method based on temporal patterns for the snapshots using the subgraph embedding technique and gaussian-base KL divergence. At the time, the association method \ufb01nds intra-snapshots and inter-snapshots associations. As a result, we can obtain an evolving graph that is simpli\ufb01ed and temporal patterns-enhanced from original networks. It is used an input graph for a GNN-based anomaly detection model. To show the superiority of the proposed framework, we conduct experiments and evaluations on 8 real-world datasets with anomaly labels with comparative state-of-the-art models of graph-based anomaly detection. We show that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the accuracy and stability of training with the trend of decreasing train loss.",

    "abstract": "Anomaly detection (such as telecom fraud detection and medical image detection) has attracted the increasing attention of people. The complex interaction between multiple entities widely exists in the network, which can reflect specific human behavior patterns. Such patterns can be modeled by higher-order network structures, thus benefiting anomaly detection on attributed networks. However, due to the lack of an effective mechanism in most existing graph learning methods, these complex interaction patterns fail to be applied in detecting anomalies, hindering the progress of anomaly detection to some extent. In order to address the aforementioned issue, we present a higher-order structure based anomaly detection (GUIDE) method. We exploit attribute autoencoder and structure autoencoder to reconstruct node attributes and higher-order structures, respectively. Moreover, we design a graph attention layer to evaluate the significance of neighbors to nodes through their higher-order structure differences. Finally, we leverage node attribute and higher-order structure reconstruction errors to find anomalies. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets (i.e., ACM, Citation, Cora, DBLP, and Pubmed) are implemented to verify the effectiveness of GUIDE. Experimental results in terms of ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, and Recall@K show that GUIDE significantly outperforms the state-of-art methods.",

To address this problem, in this paper, we propose AutoAno, a self-supervised learning model that leverages both multi-scale feature and multivariate Gaussian estimation to achieve robust anomaly localization. In detail, our method extracts multi-scale features from the patches of an image, which can simultaneously consider global, contextual, and local features, so that contains richer semantic information to anomaly localization. We then employ multidimensional Gaussian distribution to estimate the low-dimensional representation for the normal samples in training data. Notably, we discard the commonly used reconstruction loss, and instead use the distance between multi-scale feature and the estimated Gaussian distribution to detect and localize the anomalies. To verify the effectiveness of our work, we compare AutoAno with the prevailing models with extensive experiments on benchmark and real-world datasets. The empirical results demonstrate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art models significantly.",

    "abstract": "Businesses are bombarded with great deals of risks, vulnerabilities, and unforeseen business interruptions in their lifetime, which negatively affect their productivity and sustainability within the market. Such risks require a risk management system to identify risks and risk factors and propose approaches to eliminate or reduce them. Risk management involves highly structured practices that should be implemented within an organization, including organizational planning documents. Continuity planning and fraud detection policy development are among the many critically important practices conducted through risk management that aim to mitigate risk factors, their vulnerability, and their impact. Information systems play a pivotal role in any organization by providing many benefits, such as reducing human errors and associated risks owing to the employment of sophisticated algorithms. Both the development and establishment of an information system within an organization contributes to mitigating business-related risks and also creates new types of risks associated with its establishment. Businesses must prepare for, react to, and recover from unprecedented threats that might emerge in the years or decades that follow. This paper provides a comprehensive narrative review of risk management in information systems coupled with its application in fraud detection and continuity planning.",

    "abstract": "A payment network contains transactions between sellers and buyers. Detecting risky (or bad) sellers on such a payment network is crucial to payment service providers for risk management and legal compliance. In this research, we formulate this task as a node classification task. Specifically, we aim to predict a label for each seller in a payment network, by analysing its properties and/or interactions. Nodes residing in different parts of a payment network can have similar local topology structures. Such local topology structures reveal sellers' business roles, eg., supplier, drop-shipper, or retailer. We note that many existing solutions for graph-based node classification only consider node connectivity but not the similarity between node's local topology structure. Motivated by business need, we present a dual-path graph convolution network, named DP-GCN, for node classification. DP-GCN considers both node connectivity and topology structure similarity. The proposed model consists of three main modules: (i) a C-GCN module to capture connectivity relationships between nodes, (ii) a T-GCN module to capture topology structure similarities between nodes, and (iii) a multi-head self-attention module to align both properties. We evaluate DP-GCN on seven benchmark datasets against diverse baselines. We also provide a case study of running DP-GCN on three large-scale payment networks from PayPal, one of the leading payment service providers. Experimental results demonstrate DP-GCN's effectiveness and practicability.",

    "abstract": "Detection of fraudulent transactions is an imperative research area in the financial domain, affecting the different entities involved in the payment process. An accurate fraud detection algorithm will help in identifying fraudulent transactions, thus facilitating immediate response and dispute resolution. To this effect, this research proposes a novel framework TeGraF for detecting fraudulent transactions by modeling temporal and structural features from a given input. The proposed algorithm operates at the intersection of two key research areas: Temporal Point Processes (TPPs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Due to the wide occurrence of sequential data in the financial domain, TPPs are very useful for modeling the sequence of transactions. Parallelly, the financial domain data can also be represented as a graphical structure capturing interactions between users and vendors/merchants. Thus, the proposed algorithm utilizes the temporal features learned via the TPP based model and the structural features captured via the GNN for modeling fraudulent transactions. Different graph representation learning techniques like Node2Vec, Metapath2Vec, LINE, DeepWalk, and BiNE are employed to compare the overall performance. Experiments have been evaluated on a synthetic dataset containing 62K users and 4M transactions, which demonstrate the improved performance of the proposed technique as compared to the existing algorithms.",

    "abstract": "From small spin-offs deploying innovative software to big pharmaceutical complexes making vaccines, Research and Development (R&D) Project Portfolio Selection (PPS) is an essential strategic process for various companies. It was never easy to select a set of projects among many feasible possibilities, even for yesterday\u2019s paces. However, the world is rapidly changing, and so is R&D PPS. The portfolio objectives excel profit in the same manner that model constraints go beyond budget limitations. In parallel, project selection approaches and solving algorithms followed the increase of computational power. Despite all those changes, the importance of Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) methods and the decision criteria used for R&D PPS, there is still room for a systematic literature review (SLR) for the topic. Thus, this paper offers an SLR of the existing literature from the half-century, 1970, and onward MCDM-based R&D PPS performed in Scopus and Web of Science Core Collection. We provide a comprehensive picture of this field, show how it is changing, and highlight standard practices and research opportunities in the area. We perform a broad classification of the MCDM methods, categorized by the nature of alternatives, types of integration approach, the MCDM method itself, and types of uncertainty, by the 66 studies in the SLR database. The portfolios\u2019 classification obeys the application domain and the number of projects. We have also explored all the 263 criteria found in the literature by grouping them according to experts from five Brazilian R&D organizations that together manage portfolios valued around US$ 5 billion a year, accounting for 38% of all Brazilian annual expenditure in R&D projects. We also include a bibliometric analysis of the considered papers and research opportunities highlighted or not explored by researchers. Given the increasing number of decision-making approaches and new technologies available, we hope to provide guidance on the topic and promote knowledge production and growth concerning the usage of MCDM methods and decision criteria in R&D PPS.",

    "title": "Fraud Detection Using the Fraud Triangle Theory and Data Mining Techniques: A Literature Review",
    "abstract": "Fraud entails deception in order to obtain illegal gains; thus, it is mainly evidenced within financial institutions and is a matter of general interest. The problem is particularly complex, since perpetrators of fraud could belong to any position, from top managers to payroll employees. Fraud detection has traditionally been performed by auditors, who mainly employ manual techniques. These could take too long to process fraud-related evidence. Data mining, machine learning, and, as of recently, deep learning strategies are being used to automate this type of processing. Many related techniques have been developed to analyze, detect, and prevent fraud-related behavior, with the fraud triangle associated with the classic auditing model being one of the most important of these. This work aims to review current work related to fraud detection that uses the fraud triangle in addition to machine learning and deep learning techniques. We used the Kitchenham methodology to analyze the research works related to fraud detection from the last decade. This review provides evidence that fraud is an area of active investigation. Several works related to fraud detection using machine learning techniques were identified without the evidence that they incorporated the fraud triangle as a method for more efficient analysis.",

    "abstract": "The widespread use of computing technology has been changing relationships among people in societies. Criminals are aware of the power of the technology so that many criminal activities involve more computing systems. Money laundering has been a significant criminal activity within financial computing systems for many decades. The dynamic nature of information systems has reduced the effectiveness of existing money laundering detection mechanisms that is an important challenge for societies. In this paper, we consider machine learning algorithms as complementary solutions to existing money laundering detection mechanisms. We have focused on graph-based representation of data with Node2Vec to have better classification results for money laundering detections with machine learning algorithms. Our experimental analyses show that Node2Vec enable us to select the most convenient machine learning algorithm for money laundering detections. Received: 5 Jan 2021 Accepted: 26 Sep 2021",

    "abstract": "With the increase of the types of urban management objects, the intelligent management of the whole city has become a matter of concern in various countries, and it is also one of the indispensable links in urban development. In the construction of cities all over the world, the intelligent and scientific management system has been used innovatively. We provide excellent facilities for transportation development, information exchange, and resource progress. The research on urban fine management based on multisource spatial data fusion is proposed. Aiming at the traffic problems in urban fine management, this paper proposes a deep network architecture based on multisource data fusion. Multisource spatial data fusion technology is used to analyze urban traffic data. Deep network architecture is used to improve the precision management status of a smart city and the accuracy of traffic condition prediction. Then, the convolution neural network technology is explored in the data fusion technology strategy. The research results show that the framework has the ability to deal with heterogeneous data and urban big data and can effectively improve the traffic management state in the construction of a smart city and effectively solve the complexity of urban fine management and processing efficiency in the construction of a smart city.",

    "title": "Generative and Contrastive Self-Supervised Learning for Graph Anomaly Detection",
    "abstract": "Anomaly detection from graph data has drawn much attention due to its practical significance in many critical applications including cybersecurity, finance, and social networks. Existing data mining and machine learning methods are either shallow methods that could not effectively capture the complex interdependency of graph data or graph autoencoder methods that could not fully exploit the contextual information as supervision signals for effective anomaly detection. To overcome these challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel method, Self-Supervised Learning for Graph Anomaly Detection (SL-GAD). Our method constructs different contextual subgraphs (views) based on a target node and employs two modules, generative attribute regression and multi-view contrastive learning for anomaly detection. While the generative attribute regression module allows us to capture the anomalies in the attribute space, the multi-view contrastive learning module can exploit richer structure information from multiple subgraphs, thus abling to capture the anomalies in the structure space, mixing of structure, and attribute information. We conduct extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets and the results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.",

    "abstract": "Anomalies represent rare observations (e.g., data records or events) that deviate significantly from others. Over several decades, research on anomaly mining has received increasing interests due to the implications of these occurrences in a wide range of disciplines. Anomaly detection, which aims to identify rare observations, is among the most vital tasks in the world, and has shown its power in preventing detrimental events, such as financial fraud, network intrusion, and social spam. The detection task is typically solved by identifying outlying data points in the feature space and inherently overlooks the relational information in real-world data. Graphs have been prevalently used to represent the structural information, which raises the graph anomaly detection problem - identifying anomalous graph objects (i.e., nodes, edges and sub-graphs) in a single graph, or anomalous graphs in a database/set of graphs. However, conventional anomaly detection techniques cannot tackle this problem well because of the complexity of graph data. For the advent of deep learning, graph anomaly detection with deep learning has received a growing attention recently. In this survey, we aim to provide a systematic and comprehensive review of the contemporary deep learning techniques for graph anomaly detection. We compile open-sourced implementations, public datasets, and commonly-used evaluation metrics to provide affluent resources for future studies. More importantly, we highlight twelve extensive future research directions according to our survey results covering unsolved and emerging research problems and real-world applications. With this survey, our goal is to create a\"one-stop-shop\"that provides a unified understanding of the problem categories and existing approaches, publicly available hands-on resources, and high-impact open challenges for graph anomaly detection using deep learning.",

    "abstract": "Misrepresentation of money is a developing issue in monetary business with far-reaching consequences and keeping in mind that many processes have been found. A data quality management with data mining has been effectively applied to data sets to mechanize the investigation of massive amounts of complex information. Data mining has likewise played a notable role in identifying credit card fraud in online exchanges. Fraud detection in credit card is a data quality management issue that considered under data mining, tested for two important reasons \u2014 first, the profiles of ordinary and false practices habitually change, and also because of the explanation that charge card fraud information is exceptionally slow. This research paper examines the performance of Decision Trees, Logistics Regression, and Random Forest relies strategically on profoundly skewed credit card fraud data. The dataset of credit card transaction is sourced from Kaggle (a publically accessible dataset repository) with 284,807 transactions. These methods are applied to raw data values and data preprocessing techniques. Assessment of the performance of techniques depends on accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and recall. Results indicate the optimal accuracy for the decision trees, logistics regression, and random forest classifiers with 90.8%, 98.5%, and 99.1% respectively.",

    "abstract": "Graph-based fraud detection approaches have escalated lots of attention recently due to the abundant relational information of graph-structured data, which may be beneficial for the detection of fraudsters. However, the GNN-based algorithms could fare poorly when the label distribution of nodes is heavily skewed, and it is common in sensitive areas such as financial fraud, etc. To remedy the class imbalance problem of graph-based fraud detection, we propose a Pick and Choose Graph Neural Network (PC-GNN for short) for imbalanced supervised learning on graphs. First, nodes and edges are picked with a devised label-balanced sampler to construct sub-graphs for mini-batch training. Next, for each node in the sub-graph, the neighbor candidates are chosen by a proposed neighborhood sampler. Finally, information from the selected neighbors and different relations are aggregated to obtain the final representation of a target node. Experiments on both benchmark and real-world graph-based fraud detection tasks demonstrate that PC-GNN apparently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.",

    "abstract": "Financial technology, or Fintech, represents an emerging industry on the global market. With online transactions on the rise, the use of IT for automation of financial services is of increasing importance. Fintech enables institutions to deliver services to customers worldwide on a 24/7 basis. Its services are often easy to access and enable customers to perform transactions in real-time. In fact, advantages such as these make Fintech increasingly popular among clients. However, since Fintech transactions are made up of information, ensuring security becomes a critical issue. Vulnerabilities in such systems leave them exposed to fraudulent acts, which cause severe damage to clients and providers alike. For this reason, techniques from the area of Machine Learning (ML) are applied to identify anomalies in Fintech applications. They target suspicious activity in financial datasets and generate models in order to anticipate future frauds. We contribute to this important issue and provide an evaluation on anomaly detection methods for this matter. Experiments were conducted on several fraudulent datasets from real-world and synthetic databases, respectively. The obtained results confirm that ML methods contribute to fraud detection with varying success. Therefore, we discuss the effectiveness of the individual methods with regard to the detection rate. In addition, we provide an analysis on the influence of selected features on their performance. Finally, we discuss the impact of the observed results for the security of Fintech applications in the future.",

    "title": "A Method to Detect Anomalies in Complex Socio-Technical Operations Using Structural Similarity",
    "abstract": "Traditional techniques for accident investigation have hindsight biases. Specifically, they isolate the process of the accident event and trace backward from the event to determine the factors leading to the accident. Nonetheless, the importance of the contributing factors towards a successful operation is not considered in conventional accident modeling. The Safety-II approach promotes an examination of successful operations as well as failures. The rationale is that there is an opportunity to learn from successful operations, in addition to failure, and there is an opportunity to further differentiate failure processes from successful operations. The functional resonance analysis method (FRAM) has the capacity to monitor the functionality and performance of a complex socio-technical system. The method can model many possible ways a system could function, then captures the specifics of the functionality of individual operational events in functional signatures. However, the method does not support quantitative analysis of the functional signatures, which may demonstrate similarities as well as differences among each other. This paper proposes a method to detect anomalies in operations using functional signatures. The present work proposes how FRAM data models can be converted to graphs and how such graphs can be used to estimate anomalies in the data. The proposed approach is applied to human performance data obtained from ice-management tasks performed by a cohort of cadets and experienced seafarers in a ship simulator. The results show that functional differences can be captured by the proposed approach even though the differences were undetected by usual statistical measures.",

    "title": "Unsupervised Anomaly Detection with Distillated Teacher-Student Network Ensemble",
    "abstract": "We address the problem of unsupervised anomaly detection for multivariate data. Traditional machine learning based anomaly detection algorithms rely on specific assumptions of normal patterns and fail to model complex feature interactions and relations. Recently, existing deep learning based methods are promising for extracting representations from complex features. These methods train an auxiliary task, e.g., reconstruction and prediction, on normal samples. They further assume that anomalies fail to perform well on the auxiliary task since they are never trained during the model optimization. However, the assumption does not always hold in practice. Deep models may also perform the auxiliary task well on anomalous samples, leading to the failure detection of anomalies. To effectively detect anomalies for multivariate data, this paper introduces a teacher-student distillation based framework Distillated Teacher-Student Network Ensemble (DTSNE). The paradigm of the teacher-student distillation is able to deal with high-dimensional complex features. In addition, an ensemble of student networks provides a better capability to avoid generalizing the auxiliary task performance on anomalous samples. To validate the effectiveness of our model, we conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets. Experimental results show superior performance of DTSNE over competing methods. Analysis and discussion towards the behavior of our model are also provided in the experiment section.",

    "abstract": "Online advertising has become the backbone of the Internet economy by revolutionizing business marketing. It provides a simple and efficient way for advertisers to display their advertisements to specific individual users, and over the last couple of years has contributed to an explosion in the income stream for several Web-based businesses. For example, Google\u2019s income from advertising grew 51.6% between 2016 and 2018, to $\\$ $ 136.8 billion. This exponential growth in advertising revenue has motivated fraudsters to exploit the weaknesses of the online advertising model to make money, and researchers to discover new security vulnerabilities in the model, to propose countermeasures and to forecast future trends in research. Motivated by these considerations, this paper presents a comprehensive review of the security threats to online advertising systems. We begin by introducing the motivation for online advertising system, explain how it differs from traditional advertising networks, introduce terminology, and define the current online advertising architecture. We then devise a comprehensive taxonomy of attacks on online advertising to raise awareness among researchers about the vulnerabilities of online advertising ecosystem. We discuss the limitations and effectiveness of the countermeasures that have been developed to secure entities in the advertising ecosystem against these attacks. To complete our work, we identify some open issues and outline some possible directions for future research towards improving security methods for online advertising systems.",

    "abstract": "\u2212The high number of credit card fraud causes a lot of losses for both users and credit service providers. Because the rate of credit card transactions is very fast, it is necessary to detect credit card fraud as early as possible. However, another challenge that is no less important is the amount of data that is imbalanced between valid and invalid transactions. One solution to the problem of data imbalance is to use a resampling method that can improve the quantity of data so that the accuracy results are good. In this study, three types of resampling methods were implemented, SMOTE, bootstrap, and jackknife. Furthermore, to validate the success of the resampling method, three types of machine learning methods were used. The machine learning methods are SVM, ANN, and random forest. From the test results, it was found that the combination of resampling SMOTE and random forest methods produced the best performance with values of accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score of 99.95%, 81.63%, 90.91% and 86.02%, respectively.",

The management of a quality data with mining of data has been successfully applied to dataset to automate the examination of vast measures of complex data. Similarly, data mining has played a major role in isolating frauds like credit card during online trades. Detection of fraud at credit card is a management of quality data issue considered under data mining, attempted for two important reasons first, the profiles of standard and fraudulent practices change regularly, and furthermore, clarifications are needed. Second, credit card, extortion data is surprisingly sluggish. This research paper examines the performance of Decision Trees, Logistics Regression, and Random Forests that rely on deliberately heavily tilted credit cards fraud data. The dataset of credit card transaction is sourced from Kaggle (a publicly available dataset repository) with total number of transactions 284,807. These strategies are applied to values of raw data and data processing methods. Evaluation of the performance of methods depends on accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and recall.

Based on a real-world dataset and a simulated dataset, we conducted two comparative studies to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves the similar predictive performance as the state-of-art method, while our method can generate clear causal explanations for a few labeled time series data.

    "abstract": "In recent years, the unprecedented growth in digital payments fueled consequential changes in fraud and financial crimes. In this new landscape, traditional fraud detection approaches such as rule-based engines have largely become ineffective. AI and machine learning solutions using graph computing principles have gained significant interest. Graph neural networks and emerging adaptive solutions provide compelling opportunities for the future of fraud and financial crime detection. However, implementing the graph-based solutions in financial transaction processing systems has brought numerous obstacles and application considerations to light. In this paper, we overview the latest trends in the financial crimes landscape and discuss the implementation difficulties current and emerging graph solutions face. We argue that the application demands and implementation challenges provide key insights in developing effective solutions.",

    "abstract": "Credit card fraud is an ongoing problem for almost all industries in the world, and it raises millions of dollars to the global economy each year. Therefore, there is a number of research either completed or proceeding in order to detect these kinds of frauds in the industry. These researches generally use rule-based or novel artificial intelligence approaches to find eligible solutions. The ultimate goal of this paper is to summarize state-of-the-art approaches to fraud detection using artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques. While summarizing, we will categorize the common problems such as imbalanced dataset, real time working scenarios, and feature engineering challenges that almost all research works encounter, and identify general approaches to solve them. The imbalanced dataset problem occurs because the number of legitimate transactions is much higher than the fraudulent ones whereas applying the right feature engineering is substantial as the features obtained from the industries are limited, and applying feature engineering methods and reforming the dataset is crucial. Also, adapting the detection system to real time scenarios is a challenge since the number of credit card transactions in a limited time period is very high. In addition, we will discuss how evaluation metrics and machine learning methods differentiate among each research.",

    "abstract": "Financial services generate a huge volume of data that is extremely complex and varied. These datasets are often stored in silos within organisations for various reasons, including but not limited to regulatory requirements and business needs. As a result, data sharing within different lines of business as well as outside of the organisation (e.g. to the research community) is severely limited. It is therefore critical to investigate methods for synthesising financial datasets that follow the same properties of the real data while respecting the need for privacy of the parties involved. This introductory paper aims to highlight the growing need for effective synthetic data generation in the financial domain. We highlight three main areas of focus that are of particular importance while generating synthetic financial datasets: 1) Generating realistic synthetic datasets. 2) Measuring the similarities between real and generated datasets. 3) Ensuring the generative process satisfies any privacy constraints. Although these challenges are also present in other domains, the additional regulatory and privacy requirements within financial services present unique questions that are not asked elsewhere. Due to the size and influence of the financial services industry, answering these questions has the potential for a great and lasting impact. Finally, we aim to develop a shared vocabulary and context for generating synthetic financial data using two types of financial datasets as examples.",

    "abstract": "The expanding growth of computer and communication technologies results in a vast amount of security concerns. Various types of cyber-security enabled mechanisms have been developed to limit these concerns. Anomaly detection is among these mechanisms. Anomaly detection means using multiple techniques and methods to detect different patterns that do not conform to defined features of whole data. Recently, deep learning techniques adopted as a satisfactory solution because of its ability to extract data features from data itself. Convolution neural network (CNN) is mainly utilized because of its ability to process input with multi-dimensions. In this paper, a comprehensive survey about using CNN as a key solution for anomaly detection is provided. Most of the existing solutions in the literature have been gathered and classified according to the input data source; furthermore, this paper suggests a unified cross framework that simulates end-to-end anomaly detection mechanisms that exist in the previous studies. A unified cross framework enriches this paper with in-depth analysis to clarify how the solution in the literature uses CNN in anomaly detection. Finally, this paper suggests several future research directions that can support the audience in their future works in this context.",

    "abstract": "Financial statement fraud is an area of significant consternation for potential investors, auditing companies, and state regulators. Intelligent systems facilitate detecting financial statement fraud and assist the decision-making of relevant stakeholders. Previous research detected instances in which financial statements have been fraudulently misrepresented in managerial comments. The paper aims to investigate whether it is possible to develop an enhanced system for detecting financial fraud through the combination of information sourced from financial ratios and managerial comments within corporate annual reports. We employ a hierarchical attention network (HAN) with a long short-term memory (LSTM) encoder to extract text features from the Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) section of annual reports. The model is designed to offer two distinct features. First, it reflects the structured hierarchy of documents, which previous models were unable to capture. Second, the model embodies two different attention mechanisms at the word and sentence level, which allows content to be differentiated in terms of its importance in the process of constructing the document representation. As a result of its architecture, the model captures both content and context of managerial comments, which serve as supplementary predictors to financial ratios in the detection of fraudulent reporting. Additionally, the model provides interpretable indicators denoted as \u201cred-flag\u201d sentences, which assist stakeholders in their process of determining whether further investigation of a specific annual report is required. Empirical results demonstrate that textual features of MD&A sections extracted by HAN yield promising classification results and substantially reinforce financial ratios.",

    "abstract": "This research study investigates the efficiency of different information retrieval (IR) systems in accessing relevant information from the scientific literature during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study applies the TREC framework to the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) and evaluates BM25, Contriever, and Bag of Embeddings IR frameworks. The objective is to build a test collection for search engines that tackle the complex information landscape during a pandemic. The study uses the CORD-19 dataset to train and evaluate the IR models and compares the results to those manually labeled in the TREC-COVID IR Challenge. The results indicate that advanced IR models like BERT and Contriever better retrieve relevant information during a pandemic. However, the study also highlights the challenges in processing large datasets and the need for strategies to focus on abstracts or summaries. Overall, the research highlights the importance of effectively tailored IR systems in dealing with information overload during crises like COVID-19 and can guide future research and development in this field.",

    "abstract": "Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have been increasingly used to overcome the challenges in drug discovery. Although traditional AI techniques generally have high accuracy rates, there may be difficulties in explaining the decision process and patterns. This can create difficulties in understanding and making sense of the outputs of algorithms used in drug discovery. Therefore, using explainable AI (XAI) techniques, the causes and consequences of the decision process are better understood. This can help further improve the drug discovery process and make the right decisions. To address this issue, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) emerged as a process and method that securely captures the results and outputs of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms. Using techniques such as SHAP (SHApley Additive ExPlanations) and LIME (Locally Interpretable Model-Independent Explanations) has made the drug targeting phase clearer and more understandable. XAI methods are expected to reduce time and cost in future computational drug discovery studies. This review provides a comprehensive overview of XAI-based drug discovery and development prediction. XAI mechanisms to increase confidence in AI and modeling methods. The limitations and future directions of XAI in drug discovery are also discussed.",

    "abstract": "The pandemic of COVID-19 has inspired extensive works across different research fields. Existing literature and knowledge platforms on COVID-19 only focus on collecting papers on biology and medicine, neglecting the interdisciplinary efforts, which hurdles knowledge sharing and research collaborations between fields to address the problem. Studying interdisciplinary researches requires effective paper category classification and efficient cross-domain knowledge extraction and integration. In this work, we propose Covidia, COVID-19 interdisciplinary academic knowledge graph to bridge the gap between knowledge of COVID-19 on different domains. We design frameworks based on contrastive learning for disciplinary classification, and propose a new academic knowledge graph scheme for entity extraction, relation classification and ontology management in accordance with interdisciplinary researches. Based on Covidia, we also establish knowledge discovery benchmarks for finding COVID-19 research communities and predicting potential links.",

The construction used open-source tools to extract entities, relations and triples. Then, the COVID-19 KG is evaluated on three data-quality dimensions: correctness, relatedness and comprehensiveness, using a semiautomatic approach. Finally, this study assesses the application of the KG by building a question answering (Q&A) system. Five queries regarding COVID-19 genomes, symptoms, transmissions and therapeutics were submitted to the system and the results were analyzed.\n\n\nFindings\nWith current extraction tools, the quality of the KG is moderate and difficult to improve, unless more efforts are made to improve the tools for entity extraction, relation extraction and others. This study finds that comprehensiveness and relatedness positively correlate with the data size. Furthermore, the results indicate the performances of the Q&A systems built on the larger-scale KGs are better than the smaller ones for most queries, proving the importance of relatedness and comprehensiveness to ensure the usefulness of the KG.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThe KG construction process, data-quality-based and application-based evaluations discussed in this paper provide valuable references for KG researchers and practitioners to build high-quality domain-specific knowledge discovery systems.\n",

    "title": "KGML-xDTD: A Knowledge Graph-based Machine Learning Framework for Drug Treatment Prediction and Mechanism Description",
    "abstract": "Background Computational drug repurposing is a cost- and time-efficient approach that aims to identify new therapeutic targets or diseases (indications) of existing drugs/compounds. It is especially critical for emerging and/or orphan diseases due to its cheaper investment and shorter research cycle compared with traditional wet-lab drug discovery approaches. However, the underlying mechanisms of action (MOAs) between repurposed drugs and their target diseases remain largely unknown, which is still a main obstacle for computational drug repurposing methods to be widely adopted in clinical settings. Results In this work, we propose KGML-xDTD : a Knowledge Graph-based Machine Learning framework for explainably predicting Drugs Treating Diseases. It is a two-module framework that not only predicts the treatment probabilities between drugs/compounds and diseases but also biologically explains them via knowledge graph (KG) path-based, testable mechanisms of action (MOAs). We leverage knowledge-and-publication based information to extract biologically meaningful \u201cdemonstration paths\u201d as the intermediate guidance in the Graph-based Reinforcement Learning (GRL) path-finding process. Comprehensive experiments and case study analyses show that the proposed framework can achieve state-of-the-art performance in both predictions of drug repurposing and recapitulation of human-curated drug MOA paths. Conclusions KGML-xDTD is the first model framework that can offer KG-path explanations for drug repurposing predictions by leveraging the combination of prediction outcomes and existing biological knowledge and publications. We believe it can effectively reduce \u201cblack-box\u201d concerns and increase prediction confidence for drug repurposing based on predicted path-based explanations, and further accelerate the process of drug discovery for emerging diseases.",

    "abstract": "Temporal knowledge graph, serving as an effective way to store and model dynamic relations, shows promising prospects in event forecasting. However, most temporal knowledge graph reasoning methods are highly dependent on the recurrence or periodicity of events, which brings challenges to inferring future events related to entities that lack historical interaction. In fact, the current moment is often the combined effect of a small part of historical information and those unobserved underlying factors. To this end, we propose a new event forecasting model called Contrastive Event Network (CENET), based on a novel training framework of historical contrastive learning. CENET learns both the historical and non-historical dependency to distinguish the most potential entities that can best match the given query. Simultaneously, it trains representations of queries to investigate whether the current moment depends more on historical or non-historical events by launching contrastive learning. The representations further help train a binary classifier whose output is a boolean mask to indicate related entities in the search space. During the inference process, CENET employs a mask-based strategy to generate the final results. We evaluate our proposed model on five benchmark graphs. The results demonstrate that CENET significantly outperforms all existing methods in most metrics, achieving at least $8.3\\%$ relative improvement of Hits@1 over previous state-of-the-art baselines on event-based datasets.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies in machine learning have demonstrated the effectiveness of applying graph neural networks (GNNs) to single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to predict COVID-19 disease states. In this study, we propose a graph attention capsule network (GACapNet) which extracts and fuses Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transcriptomic patterns to improve node classification performance on cells and genes. Significantly different from the existing GNN approaches, we innovatively incorporate a capsule layer with dynamic routing into our model architecture to combine and fuse gene features effectively and to allow those more prominent gene features present in the output. We evaluate our GACapNet model on two scRNA-seq datasets, and the experimental results show that our GACapNet model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models. Therefore, our study demonstrates the capability of advanced machine learning models to generate predictive features and evolutionary patterns of the SARS-CoV-2 pathogen, and the applicability of closing knowledge gaps in the pathogenesis and recovery of COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Medical Coding (MC) converts medical diagnoses, procedures, equipment, and services into alphanumeric codes. Automated Medical Code prediction systems use Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques. They could save insurance companies, Government agencies, and medical staff from the hassle of reading lengthy summaries to prepare insurance claims for reimbursement of expenses and fees. If not wholly correct, these machine-understandable codes can still help the medical coders to ease their task of predicting accurate medical codes. Despite being helpful, labor-saving, and efficient, these decision support systems fizzle out due to scarcity of domain knowledge. Knowledge Graphs containing a network of concepts, their meta-data, and a hierarchy of relationships in specific domains can help build the applications of Computer Assisted Coding (CAC) with much more accurate and precise results glued with Explainability. Unfortunately, domain-specific Knowledge Graphs (KG) creation is a grueling task, as it requires healthcare experts\u2019 intervention to annotate the medical concepts. Our proposed approach is to create a framework for the Automated Generation of Knowledge Graphs, which is yet a manual and time-consuming process, with the help of Natural Language Processing, Ontology-based information retrieval, and a semantic enrichment process. The created domain-specific Knowledge graph is then fused with a Deep Learning model. Predictions made by the Deep Learning model were compared before and after the consolidation of the domain-specific Knowledge Graph. We created a web-based application to save users from the complexity of the Deep learning model and knowledge graphs. Results proved the significance of the combination of Knowledge graphs and Artificial Intelligence. Produced results yield increased precision and accuracy with fewer false-positive results.",

However, in conjunction with a lack of a representative KG construction taxonomy, several existing approaches in this designated domain are inadequate and inferior. This paper is the first to provide a comprehensive taxonomy and a bird's eye view of healthcare KG construction. Additionally, a thorough examination of the current state-of-the-art techniques drawn from academic works relevant to various healthcare contexts is carried out. These techniques are critically evaluated in terms of methods used for knowledge extraction, types of the knowledge base and sources, and the incorporated evaluation protocols. Finally, several research findings and existing issues in the literature are reported and discussed, opening horizons for future research in this vibrant area.",

    "abstract": "More and more movies and television plays have been produced in recent years, but a few have succeeded in the market. Therefore, the analysis and speculation of the success factors of movies and television plays are very important for the producers and investors. The existing analysis platform only analyzes the benefits generated by movies and television dramas in a certain period and lacks the ability of prediction and reasoning. To analyze the key factors affecting the success of movies and television dramas and provide a reference for producers and investors, we design and implement a movies and television plays analysis system combined with a knowledge graph and data visualization technology. First of all, we crawl the information of movies and television plays and user comments on the Douban website; Then, the entities and relationships are extracted by OpenUE toolkit, and Neo4j is used to construct and store the knowledge graph in movies and television plays. On this basis, we utilize the improved TransR algorithm for knowledge completion and reasoning. Finally, combined with the knowledge graph, we analyze the success factors of popular movies and TV plays and visualize the analysis results in various chart types.",

    "abstract": "Symbolic knowledge graphs (KGs) have been constructed either by expensive human crowdsourcing or with complex text mining pipelines. The emerging large pretrained language models (LMs), such as Bert, have shown to implicitly encode massive knowledge which can be queried with properly designed prompts. However, compared to the explicit KGs, the implict knowledge in the black-box LMs is often difficult to access or edit and lacks explainability. In this work, we aim at harvesting symbolic KGs from the LMs, and propose a new framework for automatic KG construction empowered by the neural LMs' flexibility and scalability. Compared to prior works that often rely on large human annotated data or existing massive KGs, our approach requires only the minimal definition of relations as inputs, and hence is suitable for extracting knowledge of rich new relations that are instantly assigned and not available before. The framework automatically generates diverse prompts, and performs efficient knowledge search within a given LM for consistent outputs. The knowledge harvested with our approach shows competitive quality, diversity, and novelty. As a result, we derive from diverse LMs a family of new KGs (e.g., BertNet and RoBERTaNet) that contain a richer set of relations, including some complex ones (e.g.,\"A is capable of but not good at B\") that cannot be extracted with previous methods. Besides, the resulting KGs also serve as a vehicle to interpret the respective source LMs, leading to new insights into the varying knowledge capability of different LMs.",

    "abstract": "Abstract. The longer the COVID-19 pandemic lasts, the more apparent it becomes that understanding its social drivers may be as important as understanding the virus itself. One such social driver is misinformation and distrust in institutions. This is particularly interesting as the scientific process is more transparent than ever before. Numerous scientific teams have published datasets that cover almost any imaginable aspects of COVID-19 during the last two years. However, consistently and efficiently integrating and making sense of these separate data \u201csilos\u201d to scientists, decision makers, journalists, and more importantly the general public remain a key challenge with important implications for transparency. Several types of knowledge graphs have been published to tackle this issue and to enable data crosswalks by providing rich contextual information. Interestingly, none of these graphs has focused on COVID-19 forecasts despite them acting as the underpinning for decision making. In this work we motivate the need for exposing forecasts as a knowledge graph, showcase queries that run against the graph, and geographically interlink forecasts with indicators of economic impacts.\n",

    "abstract": "As the demands for large-scale information processing have grown, knowledge graph-based approaches have gained prominence for representing general and domain knowledge. The development of such general representations is essential, particularly in domains such as manufacturing which intelligent processes and adaptive education can enhance. Despite the continuous accumulation of text in these domains, the lack of structured data has created information extraction and knowledge transfer barriers. In this paper, we report on work towards developing robust knowledge graphs based upon entity and relation data for both commercial and educational uses. To create the FabKG (Manufacturing knowledge graph), we have utilized textbook index words, research paper keywords, FabNER (manufacturing NER), to extract a sub knowledge base contained within Wikidata. Moreover, we propose a novel crowdsourcing method for KG creation by leveraging student notes, which contain invaluable information but are not captured as meaningful information, excluding their use in personal preparation for learning and written exams. We have created a knowledge graph containing 65000+ triples using all data sources. We have also shown the use case of domain-specific question answering and expression/formula-based question answering for educational purposes.",

    "abstract": "The medical conversational system can relieve the burden of doctors and improve the efficiency of healthcare, especially during the pandemic. This paper presents a medical conversational question answering (CQA) system based on the multi-modal knowledge graph, namely\"LingYi\", which is designed as a pipeline framework to maintain high flexibility. Our system utilizes automated medical procedures including medical triage, consultation, image-text drug recommendation and record. To conduct knowledge-grounded dialogues with patients, we first construct a Chinese Medical Multi-Modal Knowledge Graph (CM3KG) and collect a large-scale Chinese Medical CQA (CMCQA) dataset. Compared with the other existing medical question-answering systems, our system adopts several state-of-the-art technologies including medical entity disambiguation and medical dialogue generation, which is more friendly to provide medical services to patients. In addition, we have open-sourced our codes which contain back-end models and front-end web pages at https://github.com/WENGSYX/LingYi. The datasets including CM3KG at https://github.com/WENGSYX/CM3KG and CMCQA at https://github.com/WENGSYX/CMCQA are also released to further promote future research.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning has huge potential to revolutionize the field of drug discovery and is attracting increasing attention in recent years. However, lacking domain knowledge (e.g., which tasks to work on), standard benchmarks and data preprocessing pipelines are the main obstacles for machine learning researchers to work in this domain. To facilitate the progress of machine learning for drug discovery, we develop TorchDrug, a powerful and flexible machine learning platform for drug discovery built on top of PyTorch. TorchDrug benchmarks a variety of important tasks in drug discovery, including molecular property prediction, pretrained molecular representations, de novo molecular design and optimization, retrosynthsis prediction, and biomedical knowledge graph reasoning. State-of-the-art techniques based on geometric deep learning (or graph machine learning), deep generative models, reinforcement learning and knowledge graph reasoning are implemented for these tasks. TorchDrug features a hierarchical interface that facilitates customization from both novices and experts in this domain. Tutorials, benchmark results and documentation are available at https://torchdrug.ai. Code is released under Apache License 2.0.",

    "abstract": "Abstract SARS-CoV-2 caused the first severe pandemic of the digital era. Computational approaches have been ubiquitously used in an attempt to timely and effectively cope with the resulting global health crisis. In order to extensively assess such contribution, we collected, categorized and prioritized over 17 000 COVID-19-related research articles including both peer-reviewed and preprint publications that make a relevant use of computational approaches. Using machine learning methods, we identified six broad application areas i.e. Molecular Pharmacology and Biomarkers, Molecular Virology, Epidemiology, Healthcare, Clinical Medicine and Clinical Imaging. We then used our prioritization model as a guidance through an extensive, systematic review of the most relevant studies. We believe that the remarkable contribution provided by computational applications during the ongoing pandemic motivates additional efforts toward their further development and adoption, with the aim of enhancing preparedness and critical response for current and future emergencies.",

    "abstract": "Several global health incidents and evidences show the increasing likelihood of pandemics (large\u2010scale outbreaks of infectious disease), which has adversely affected all aspects of human lives. It is essential to develop an analytics framework by extracting and incorporating the knowledge of heterogeneous data\u2010sources to deliver insights for enhancing preparedness to combat the pandemic. Specifically, human mobility, travel history, and other transport statistics have significantly impact on the spread of any infectious disease. This article proposes a spatio\u2010temporal knowledge mining framework, named STOPPAGE, to model the impact of human mobility and other contextual information over the large geographic areas in different temporal scales. The framework has two key modules: (i) spatio\u2010temporal data and computing infrastructure using fog/edge based architecture; and (ii) spatio\u2010temporal data analytics module to efficiently extract knowledge from heterogeneous data sources. We created a pandemic\u2010knowledge graph to discover correlations among mobility information and disease spread, a deep learning architecture to predict the next hotspot zones. Further, we provide necessary support in home\u2010health monitoring utilizing Femtolet and fog/edge based solutions. The experimental evaluations on real\u2010life datasets related to COVID\u201019 in India illustrate the efficacy of the proposed methods. STOPPAGE outperforms the existing works and baseline methods in terms of accuracy by \u2248$$ \\approx $$ (18\u201321)% in predicting hotspots and reduces the power consumption of the smartphone significantly. The scalability study yields that the STOPPAGE framework is flexible enough to analyze a huge amount of spatio\u2010temporal datasets and reduces the delay in predicting health status compared to the existing studies.",

    "abstract": "Drug discovery and development is a complex and costly process. Machine learning approaches are being investigated to help improve the effectiveness and speed of multiple stages of the drug discovery pipeline. Of these, those that use Knowledge Graphs (KG) have promise in many tasks, including drug repurposing, drug toxicity prediction and target gene-disease prioritization. In a drug discovery KG, crucial elements including genes, diseases and drugs are represented as entities, while relationships between them indicate an interaction. However, to construct high-quality KGs, suitable data are required. In this review, we detail publicly available sources suitable for use in constructing drug discovery focused KGs. We aim to help guide machine learning and KG practitioners who are interested in applying new techniques to the drug discovery field, but who may be unfamiliar with the relevant data sources. The datasets are selected via strict criteria, categorized according to the primary type of information contained within and are considered based upon what information could be extracted to build a KG. We then present a comparative analysis of existing public drug discovery KGs and an evaluation of selected motivating case studies from the literature. Additionally, we raise numerous and unique challenges and issues associated with the domain and its datasets, while also highlighting key future research directions. We hope this review will motivate KGs use in solving key and emerging questions in the drug discovery domain.",

    "abstract": "Biomedical events represent complex, graphical, and semantically rich interactions expressed in the scientific literature. Almost all contributions in the event realm orbit around semantic parsing, usually employing discriminative architectures and cumbersome multi-step pipelines limited to a small number of target interaction types. We present the first lightweight framework to solve both event extraction and event verbalization with a unified text-to-text approach, allowing us to fuse all the resources so far designed for different tasks. To this end, we present a new event graph linearization technique and release highly comprehensive event-text paired datasets, covering more than 150 event types from multiple biology subareas (English language). By streamlining parsing and generation to translations, we propose baseline transformer model results according to multiple biomedical text mining benchmarks and NLG metrics. Our extractive models achieve greater state-of-the-art performance than single-task competitors and show promising capabilities for the controlled generation of coherent natural language utterances from structured data.",

    "abstract": "As vision processing and natural language processing continue to advance, there is increasing interest in multimodal applications, such as image retrieval, caption generation, and human-robot interaction. These tasks require close alignment between the information in the images and text. In this paper, we present a new multimodal dataset that combines state of the art semantic annotation for language with the bounding boxes of corresponding images. This richer multimodal labeling supports cross-modal inference for applications in which such alignment is useful. Our semantic representations, developed in the natural language processing community, abstract away from the surface structure of the sentence, focusing on specific actions and the roles of their participants, a level that is equally relevant to images. We then utilize these representations in the form of semantic role labels in the captions and the images and demonstrate improvements in standard tasks such as image retrieval. The potential contributions of these additional labels is evaluated using a role-aware retrieval system based on graph convolutional and recurrent neural networks. The addition of semantic roles into this system provides a significant increase in capability and greater flexibility for these tasks, and could be extended to state-of-the-art techniques relying on transformers with larger amounts of annotated data.",

    "abstract": "Abstract COVID-19 is a worldwide health crisis seriously endangering the arsenal of antiviral and antibiotic drugs. It is urgent to find an effective antiviral drug against pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars-Cov-2), which increases global health concerns. As it can be expensive and time-consuming to develop specific antiviral drugs, reuse of FDA-approved drugs that provide an opportunity to rapidly distribute effective therapeutics can allow to provide treatments with known preclinical, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and toxicity profiles that can quickly enter in clinical trials. In this study, using the structural information of molecules and proteins, a list of repurposed drug candidates was prepared again with the graph neural network-based GEFA model. The data set from the public databases DrugBank and PubChem were used for analysis. Using the Tanimoto/jaccard similarity analysis, a list of similar drugs was prepared by comparing the drugs used in the treatment of COVID-19 with the drugs used in the treatment of other diseases. The resultant drugs were compared with the drugs used in lung cancer and repurposed drugs were obtained again by calculating the binding strength between a drug and a target. The kinase inhibitors (erlotinib, lapatinib, vandetanib, pazopanib, cediranib, dasatinib, linifanib and tozasertib) obtained from the study can be used as an alternative for the treatment of COVID-19, as a combination of blocking agents (gefitinib, osimertinib, fedratinib, baricitinib, imatinib, sunitinib and ponatinib) such as ABL2, ABL1, EGFR, AAK1, FLT3 and JAK1, or antiviral therapies (ribavirin, ritonavir-lopinavir and remdesivir).

    "abstract": "During the COVID-19 pandemic, more than ever, data science has become a powerful weapon in combating an infectious disease epidemic and arguably any future infectious disease epidemic. Computer scientists, data scientists, physicists and mathematicians have joined public health professionals and virologists to confront the largest pandemic in the century by capitalizing on the large-scale \u2018big data\u2019 generated and harnessed for combating the COVID-19 pandemic. In this paper, we review the newly born data science approaches to confronting COVID-19, including the estimation of epidemiological parameters, digital contact tracing, diagnosis, policy-making, resource allocation, risk assessment, mental health surveillance, social media analytics, drug repurposing and drug development. We compare the new approaches with conventional epidemiological studies, discuss lessons we learned from the COVID-19 pandemic, and highlight opportunities and challenges of data science approaches to confronting future infectious disease epidemics. This article is part of the theme issue \u2018Data science approaches to infectious disease surveillance\u2019.",

    "abstract": "The research of geoscience plays a strong role in helping people gain a better understanding of the Earth. To effectively represent the knowledge (KG) from enormous geoscience research papers, knowledge graphs can be a powerful means. In the face of enormous geoscience research papers, knowledge graphs can be a powerful means to manage the relationships of data and integrate knowledge extracted from them. However, the existing geoscience KGs mainly focus on the external connection between concepts, whereas the potential abundant information contained in the internal multimodal data of the paper is largely overlooked for more fine-grained knowledge mining. To this end, we propose GAKG, a large-scale multimodal academic KG based on 1.12 million papers published in various geoscience-related journals. In addition to the bibliometrics elements, we also extracted the internal illustrations, tables, and text information of the articles, and dig out the knowledge entities of the papers and the era and spatial attributes of the articles, coupling multimodal academic data and features. Specifically, GAKG realizes knowledge entity extraction under our proposed Human-In-the-Loop framework, the novelty of which is to combine the techniques of machine reading and information retrieval with manual annotation of geoscientists in the loop. Considering the fact that literature of geoscience often contains more abundant illustrations and time scale information compared with that of other disciplines, we extract all the geographical information and era from the geoscience papers' text and illustrations, mapping papers to the atlas and chronology. Based on GAKG, we build several knowledge discovery benchmarks for finding geoscience communities and predicting potential links. GAKG and its services have been made publicly available and user-friendly.",

    "abstract": "The construction and application of knowledge graphs have seen a rapid increase across many disciplines in re-cent years. Additionally, the problem of uncovering relationships between developments in the COVID-19 pandemic and social me-dia behavior is of great interest to researchers hoping to curb the spread of the disease. In this paper we present a knowledge graph constructed from COVID-19 related tweets in the Los Angeles area, supplemented with federal and state policy announcements and disease spread statistics. By incorporating dates, topics, and events as entities, we construct a knowledge graph that describes the connections between these useful information. We use natural language processing and change point analysis to extract tweet-topic, tweet-date, and event-date relations. Further analysis on the constructed knowledge graph provides insight into how tweets reflect public sentiments towards COVID-19 related topics and how changes in these sentiments correlate with real-world events.",

    "abstract": "Biomedical entity linking is the task of linking entity mentions in a biomedical document to referent entities in a knowledge base. Recently, many BERT-based models have been introduced for the task. While these models have achieved competitive results on many datasets, they are computationally expensive and contain about 110M parameters. Little is known about the factors contributing to their impressive performance and whether the over-parameterization is needed. In this work, we shed some light on the inner working mechanisms of these large BERT-based models. Through a set of probing experiments, we have found that the entity linking performance only changes slightly when the input word order is shuffled or when the attention scope is limited to a fixed window size. From these observations, we propose an efficient convolutional neural network with residual connections for biomedical entity linking. Because of the sparse connectivity and weight sharing properties, our model has a small number of parameters and is highly efficient. On five public datasets, our model achieves comparable or even better linking accuracy than the state-of-the-art BERT-based models while having about 60 times fewer parameters.",

    "abstract": "Summary Objectives: We examine the knowledge ecosystem of COVID-19, focusing on clinical knowledge and the role of health informatics as enabling technology. We argue for commitment to the model of a global learning health system to facilitate rapid knowledge translation supporting health care decision making in the face of emerging diseases. Methods and Results: We frame the evolution of knowledge in the COVID-19 crisis in terms of learning theory, and present a view of what has occurred during the pandemic to rapidly derive and share knowledge as an (underdeveloped) instance of a global learning health system. We identify the key role of information technologies for electronic data capture and data sharing, computational modelling, evidence synthesis, and knowledge dissemination. We further highlight gaps in the system and barriers to full realisation of an efficient and effective global learning health system. Conclusions: The need for a global knowledge ecosystem supporting rapid learning from clinical practice has become more apparent than ever during the COVID-19 pandemic. Continued effort to realise the vision of a global learning health system, including establishing effective approaches to data governance and ethics to support the system, is imperative to enable continuous improvement in our clinical care.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 is having a dramatic impact on research and researchers. The pandemic has underlined the severity of known challenges in research and surfaced new ones, but also accelerated the adoption of innovations and manifested new opportunities. This review considers early trends emerging from meta-research on COVID-19. In particular, it focuses on the following topics: i) mapping COVID-19 research;ii) data and machine learning;iii) research practices including open access and open data, reviewing, publishing and funding;iv) communicating research to the public;v) the impact of COVID-19 on researchers, in particular with respect to gender and career trajectories. This overview finds that most early meta-research on COVID-19 has been reactive and focused on short-term questions, while more recently a shift to consider the long-term consequences of COVID-19 is taking place. Based on these findings, the author speculates that some aspects of doing research during COVID-19 are more likely to persist than others. These include: the shift to virtual for academic events such as conferences;the use of openly accessible pre-prints;the `datafication' of scholarly literature and consequent broader adoption of machine learning in science communication;the public visibility of research and researchers on social and online media.",

    "abstract": "Background: Searching through the COVID-19 research literature to gain actionable clinical insight is a formidable task, even for experts. The usefulness of this corpus in terms of improving patient care is tied to the ability to see the big picture that emerges when the studies are seen in conjunction rather than in isolation. When the answer to a search query requires linking together multiple pieces of information across documents, simple keyword searches are insufficient. To answer such complex information needs, an innovative artificial intelligence (AI) technology named a knowledge graph (KG) could prove to be effective. Methods: We conducted an exploratory literature review of KG applications in the context of COVID-19. The search term used was \u201ccovid-19 knowledge graph\u201d. In addition to PubMed, the first five pages of search results for Google Scholar and Google were considered for inclusion. Google Scholar was used to include non-peer-reviewed or non-indexed articles such as pre-prints and conference proceedings. Google was used to identify companies or consortiums active in this domain that have not published any literature, peer-reviewed or otherwise. Results: Our search yielded 34 results on PubMed and 50 results each on Google and Google Scholar. We found KGs being used for facilitating literature search, drug repurposing, clinical trial mapping, and risk factor analysis. Conclusions: Our synopses of these works make a compelling case for the utility of this nascent field of research.",

    "abstract": "The rapidly increasing biomedical knowledge, derived from biological experiments or gained from clinical practice, has become the important treasure in the biomedical research. The emerging knowledge graphs (KGs) provide an efficient and effective way to organize and retrieval the huge and increasing volume of biomedical knowledge. A biomedical KG (BKG) typically stores and represents knowledge by constructing a semantic network describing entities and the relationships between them. Previous efforts have been conducted to construct and curate BKGs by comprehensively integrating various biomedical data resources. Though the resulting BKGs have made a significant progress in this filed in advancing biological and medical research, there remain a big gap to a perfect one that is comprehensive and fine-grained enough. To this end, in the present study, we collected and integrated data from diverse well-curated biomedical knowledge bases and BKGs to curate a more comprehensive one, named the Cornell Biomedical Knowledge Hub (CBKH). To enhance the usage in accelerating biomedical research, we deployed CBKH using the famous graph database, Neo4j. This is a continuing effort and we are adding in more and more contents in CBKH to support the various complex needs in biomedical data analysis.

    "abstract": "PurposeThe COVID-19 pandemic has sparked a remarkable volume of research literature, and scientists are increasingly in need of intelligent tools to cut through the noise and uncover relevant research directions. As a response, the authors propose a novel framework. In this framework, the authors develop a novel weighted semantic graph model to compress the research studies efficiently. Also, the authors present two analyses on this graph to propose alternative ways to uncover additional aspects of COVID-19 research.Design/methodology/approachThe authors construct the semantic graph using state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) techniques on COVID-19 publication texts (>100,000 texts). Next, the authors conduct an evolutionary analysis to capture the changes in COVID-19 research across time. Finally, the authors apply a link prediction study to detect novel COVID-19 research directions that are so far undiscovered.FindingsFindings reveal the success of the semantic graph in capturing scientific knowledge and its evolution. Meanwhile, the prediction experiments provide 79% accuracy on returning intelligible links, showing the reliability of the methods for predicting novel connections that could help scientists discover potential new directions.Originality/valueTo the authors\u2019 knowledge, this is the first study to propose a holistic framework that includes encoding the scientific knowledge in a semantic graph, demonstrates an evolutionary examination of past and ongoing research and offers scientists with tools to generate new hypotheses and research directions through predictive modeling and deep machine learning techniques.",

    "abstract": "Traditional Machine Learning (ML) models have had limited success in predicting Coronoavirus-19 (COVID-19) outcomes using Electronic Health Record (EHR) data partially due to not effectively capturing the inter-connectivity patterns between various data modalities. In this work, we propose a novel framework that utilizes relational learning based on a heterogeneous graph model (HGM) for predicting mortality at different time windows in COVID-19 patients within the intensive care unit (ICU). We utilize the EHRs of one of the largest and most diverse patient populations across five hospitals in major health system in New York City. In our model, we use an LSTM for processing time varying patient data and apply our proposed relational learning strategy in the final output layer along with other static features. Here, we replace the traditional softmax layer with a Skip-Gram relational learning strategy to compare the similarity between a patient and outcome embedding representation. We demonstrate that the construction of a HGM can robustly learn the patterns classifying patient representations of outcomes through leveraging patterns within the embeddings of similar patients. Our experimental results show that our relational learning-based HGM model achieves higher area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (auROC) than both comparator models in all prediction time windows, with dramatic improvements to recall.",

    "abstract": "A better understanding of the clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is urgently required to address this health crisis. Numerous researchers and pharmaceutical companies are working on developing vaccines and treatments; however, a clear solution has yet to be found. The current study proposes the use of artificial intelligence methods to comprehend biomedical knowledge and infer the characteristics of COVID-19. A biomedical knowledge base was established via FastText, a word embedding technique, using PubMed literature from the past decade. Subsequently, a new knowledge base was created using recently published COVID-19 articles. Using this newly constructed knowledge base from the word embedding model, a list of anti-infective drugs and proteins of either human or coronavirus origin were inferred to be related, because they are located close to COVID-19 on the knowledge base. This study attempted to form a method to quickly infer related information about COVID-19 using the existing knowledge base, before sufficient knowledge about COVID-19 is accumulated. With COVID-19 not completely overcome, machine learning-based research in the PubMed literature will provide a broad guideline for researchers and pharmaceutical companies working on treatments for COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Many attempts have been made to construct new domain-specific knowledge graphs using the existing knowledge base of various domains. However, traditional \u201cdictionary-based\u201d or \u201csupervised\u201d knowledge graph building methods rely on predefined human-annotated resources of entities and their relationships. The cost of creating human-annotated resources is high in terms of both time and effort. This means that relying on human-annotated resources will not allow rapid adaptability in describing new knowledge when domain-specific information is added or updated very frequently, such as with the recent coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic situation. Therefore, in this study, we propose an Open Information Extraction (OpenIE) system based on unsupervised learning without a pre-built dataset. The proposed method obtains knowledge from a vast amount of text documents about COVID-19 rather than a general knowledge base and add this to the existing knowledge graph. First, we constructed a COVID-19 entity dictionary, and then we scraped a large text dataset related to COVID-19. Next, we constructed a COVID-19 perspective language model by fine-tuning the bidirectional encoder representations from transformer (BERT) pre-trained language model. Finally, we defined a new COVID-19-specific knowledge base by extracting connecting words between COVID-19 entities using the BERT self-attention weight from COVID-19 sentences. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed Co-BERT model outperforms the original BERT in terms of mask prediction accuracy and metric for evaluation of translation with explicit ordering (METEOR) score.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge acquisition is the essential first step of any Knowledge Graph (KG) application. This knowledge can be extracted from a given corpus (KG generation process) or specified from an existing KG (KG specification process). Focusing on domain specific solutions, knowledge acquisition is a labor intensive task usually orchestrated and supervised by subject matter experts. Specifically, the domain of interest is usually manually defined and then the needed generation or extraction tools are utilized to produce the KG. Herein, we propose a supervised machine learning method, based on Transformers, for domain definition of a corpus. We argue why such automated definition of the domain's structure is beneficial both in terms of construction time and quality of the generated graph. The proposed method is extensively validated on three public datasets (WebNLG, NYT and DocRED) by comparing it with two reference methods based on CNNs and RNNs models. The evaluation shows the efficiency of our model in this task. Focusing on scientific document understanding, we present a new health domain dataset based on publications extracted from PubMed and we successfully utilize our method on this. Lastly, we demonstrate how this work lays the foundation for fully automated and unsupervised KG generation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract More than 50 000 papers have been published about COVID-19 since the beginning of 2020 and several hundred new papers continue to be published every day. This incredible rate of scientific productivity leads to information overload, making it difficult for researchers, clinicians and public health officials to keep up with the latest findings. Automated text mining techniques for searching, reading and summarizing papers are helpful for addressing information overload. In this review, we describe the many resources that have been introduced to support text mining applications over the COVID-19 literature; specifically, we discuss the corpora, modeling resources, systems and shared tasks that have been introduced for COVID-19. We compile a list of 39 systems that provide functionality such as search, discovery, visualization and summarization over the COVID-19 literature. For each system, we provide a qualitative description and assessment of the system\u2019s performance, unique data or user interface features and modeling decisions. Many systems focus on search and discovery, though several systems provide novel features, such as the ability to summarize findings over multiple documents or linking between scientific articles and clinical trials. We also describe the public corpora, models and shared tasks that have been introduced to help reduce repeated effort among community members; some of these resources (especially shared tasks) can provide a basis for comparing the performance of different systems. Finally, we summarize promising results and open challenges for text mining the COVID-19 literature.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic has had a significant impact on society, both because of the serious health effects of COVID-19 and because of public health measures implemented to slow its spread. Many of these difficulties are fundamentally information needs; attempts to address these needs have caused an information overload for both researchers and the public. Natural language processing (NLP)-the branch of artificial intelligence that interprets human language-can be applied to address many of the information needs made urgent by the COVID-19 pandemic. This review surveys approximately 150 NLP studies and more than 50 systems and datasets addressing the COVID-19 pandemic. We detail work on four core NLP tasks: information retrieval, named entity recognition, literature-based discovery, and question answering. We also describe work that directly addresses aspects of the pandemic through four additional tasks: topic modeling, sentiment and emotion analysis, caseload forecasting, and misinformation detection. We conclude by discussing observable trends and remaining challenges.",

These articles, along with earlier related literature, compose a valuable knowledge base affecting contemporary research studies, or even government actions to limit the spread of the disease and treatment decisions taken by physicians. However, the number of such articles is increasing at an intense rate making the exploration of the relevant literature and the identification of useful knowledge in it challenging. In this work, we describe BIP4COVID19, an open dataset compiled to facilitate the coronavirus-related literature exploration, by providing various indicators of scientific impact for the relevant articles. Additionally, we provide a publicly accessible Web interface on top of our data, allowing the exploration of the publications based on the computed indicators.",

Searching through the COVID-19 research literature to gain actionable clinical insight is a formidable task, even for experts. The usefulness of this corpus in terms of improving patient care is tied to the ability to see the big picture that emerges when the studies are seen in conjunction rather than in isolation. When the answer to a search query requires linking together multiple pieces of information across documents, simple keyword searches are insufficient. To answer such complex information needs, an innovative AI technology called a knowledge graph (KG) could prove to be effective. abstract, and tagging information. The superiority of Google Scholar over PubMed with respect to the ability to retrieve relevant articles using a quick search has been studied before. The advantages of PubMed over Google Scholar, which mainly stem from PubMed using human curation, are irrelevant for this review, because the sources identified by Google Scholar are perused by us before inclusion in the results. It would be unacceptable to use Google Scholar for a systematic review because the process must be repeatable, and human judgement used for quality evaluation is subjective (and thus not repeatable). However, for an exploratory review, this does not pose a problem, and using Google Scholar allows access to a larger number of sources (sometimes referred to as \u2018grey literature\u2019). An up-to-date comparison of these different search approaches from the perspective of a librarian can be found elsewhere. especially given its once-daily oral dosing and acceptable side-effect profile. In addition, the potential for combination therapy with baricitinib was high, including combining baricitinib with the direct-acting antivirals (lopinavir or ritonavir and remdesivir) currently being used in the COVID-19 outbreak to reduce viral infectivity, viral replication, and the aberrant host inflammatory response. This work demonstrates that a KG can facilitate rapid drug development. A trial of baricitinib plus remdesivir has already been conducted and was superior to remdesivir alone in reducing recovery time and accelerating improvement in clinical status.",

    "abstract": "Biomedical Information Extraction from scientific literature presents two unique and non-trivial challenges. First, compared with general natural language texts, sentences from scientific papers usually possess wider contexts between knowledge elements. Moreover, comprehending the fine-grained scientific entities and events urgently requires domain-specific background knowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel biomedical Information Extraction (IE) model to tackle these two challenges and extract scientific entities and events from English research papers. We perform Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) to compress the wide context to uncover a clear semantic structure for each complex sentence. Besides, we construct the sentence-level knowledge graph from an external knowledge base and use it to enrich the AMR graph to improve the model\u2019s understanding of complex scientific concepts. We use an edge-conditioned graph attention network to encode the knowledge-enriched AMR graph for biomedical IE tasks. Experiments on the GENIA 2011 dataset show that the AMR and external knowledge have contributed 1.8% and 3.0% absolute F-score gains respectively. In order to evaluate the impact of our approach on real-world problems that involve topic-specific fine-grained knowledge elements, we have also created a new ontology and annotated corpus for entity and event extraction for the COVID-19 scientific literature, which can serve as a new benchmark for the biomedical IE community.",

    "abstract": "Semantic knowledge graphs provide very significant benefits for structuring and analysing huge amounts of aggregated data across diverse heterogeneous sources. Beyond quick and efficient data query and analysis, they facilitate inference from data and generation of insights for several purposes. With the multi-faceted global challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, this research focused on the use of a semantic knowledge graph to model, structure and store COVID-related news articles centrally and semantically towards knowledge discovery, knowledge acquisition and advanced data analytics for understanding varying metrics relating to the virus towards curbing its spread. The semantic knowledge graph provides a platform for researchers, data analysts and data scientists across societal sectors to investigate and recommend strategies towards addressing the challenges it poses to the global society.",

    "abstract": "This paper details the methodologies and decisions making processes used while developing the attacking and defending models for the Graph Adversarial Attacks and Defense applied to a large citation graph. To handle the large graphs, our attack strategy is twofold: 1) randomly attack the structure first, 2) keep the structure unchanged, then continue the attack on the features using the gradient-based method. On the other hand, the defender is based on 1) filtering and normalizing the feature data, 2) applying the Graph Convolutional Network model, and 3) selecting the models with the highest accuracy and robustness based on our own attacking data. We applied these strategies in KDD Cup 2020 on Graph Adversarial Attacks and Defense dataset. The attacker can drop the accuracy of a surrogate 2-layer Graph Convolutional Network model from 60% to 30% on the test set. Our defending model has 68% accuracy on the validated data and has 89% of the target labels remained the same while adding fake nodes, generated by our attacking method, to the graph.",

    "abstract": "Motivation In the event of an outbreak due to an emerging pathogen, time is of the essence to contain or to mitigate the spread of the disease. Drug repositioning is one of the strategies that has the potential to deliver therapeutics relatively quickly. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has shown that integrating critical data resources to drive drug-repositioning studies, involving host-host, hostpathogen and drug-target interactions, remains a time-consuming effort that translates to a delay in the development and delivery of a life-saving therapy. Results Here, we describe a workflow we designed for a semi-automated integration of rapidly emerging datasets that can be generally adopted in a broad network pharmacology research setting. The workflow was used to construct a COVID-19 focused multimodal network that integrates 487 host-pathogen, 74,805 host-host protein and 1,265 drug-target interactions. The resultant Neo4j graph database named \u201cNeo4COVID19\u201d is accessible via a web interface and via API calls based on the Bolt protocol. We believe that our Neo4COVID19 database will be a valuable asset to the research community and will catalyze the discovery of therapeutics to fight COVID-19.

    "abstract": "We introduce a generic, human-out-of-the-loop pipeline, ERLKG, to perform rapid association analysis of any biomedical entity with other existing entities from a corpora of the same domain. Our pipeline consists of a Knowledge Graph (KG) created from the Open Source CORD-19 dataset by fully automating the procedure of information extraction using SciBERT. The best latent entity representations are then found by benchnmarking different KG embedding techniques on the task of link prediction using a Graph Convolution Network Auto Encoder (GCN-AE). We demonstrate the utility of ERLKG with respect to COVID-19 through multiple qualitative evaluations. Due to the lack of a gold standard, we propose a relatively large intrinsic evaluation dataset for COVID-19 and use it for validating the top two performing KG embedding techniques. We find TransD to be the best performing KG embedding technique with Pearson and Spearman correlation scores of 0.4348 and 0.4570 respectively. We demonstrate that a considerable number of ERLKG\u2019s top protein, chemical and disease predictions are currently in consideration for COVID-19 related research.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the relationship between figures and text is key to scientific document understanding. Medical figures in particular are quite complex, often consisting of several subfigures (75% of figures in our dataset), with detailed text describing their content. Previous work studying figures in scientific papers focused on classifying figure content rather than understanding how images relate to the text. To address challenges in figure retrieval and figure-to-text alignment, we introduce MedICaT, a dataset of medical images in context. MedICaT consists of 217K images from 131K open access biomedical papers, and includes captions, inline references for 74% of figures, and manually annotated subfigures and subcaptions for a subset of figures. Using MedICaT, we introduce the task of subfigure to subcaption alignment in compound figures and demonstrate the utility of inline references in image-text matching.

    "abstract": "Integrated, up-to-date data about SARS-CoV-2 and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is crucial for the ongoing response to the COVID-19 pandemic by the biomedical research community. While rich biological knowledge exists for SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV), integrating this knowledge is difficult and time consuming, since much of it is in siloed databases or in textual format. Furthermore, the data required by the research community varies drastically for different tasks - the optimal data for a machine learning task, for example, is much different from the data used to populate a browsable user interface for clinicians. To address these challenges, we created KG-COVID-19, a flexible framework that ingests and integrates biomedical data to produce knowledge graphs (KGs) for COVID-19 response. This KG framework can also be applied to other problems in which siloed biomedical data must be quickly integrated for different research applications, including future pandemics. BIGGER PICTURE An effective response to the COVID-19 pandemic relies on integration of many different types of data available about SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses. KG-COVID-19 is a framework for producing knowledge graphs that can be customized for downstream applications including machine learning tasks, hypothesis-based querying, and browsable user interface to enable researchers to explore COVID-19 data and discover relationships.",

    "abstract": "Summary The past few weeks have witnessed a worldwide mobilization of the research community in response to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). This global response has led to a burst of publications on the pathophysiology of the virus, yet without coordinated efforts to organize this knowledge, it can remain hidden away from individual research groups. By extracting and formalizing this knowledge in a structured and computable form, as in the form of a knowledge graph, researchers can readily reason and analyze this information on a much larger scale. Here, we present the COVID-19 Knowledge Graph, an expansive cause-and-effect network constructed from scientific literature on the new coronavirus that aims to provide a comprehensive view of its pathophysiology. To make this resource available to the research community and facilitate its exploration and analysis, we also implemented a web application and released the KG in multiple standard formats. Availability The COVID-19 Knowledge Graph is publicly available under CC-0 license at https://github.com/covid19kg and https://bikmi.covid19-knowledgespace.de.

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) pandemic has shown far reaching sequels in all aspects of human lives ranging from rapid growth in active cases to economic and social disruption across the world. Motivated by the urgent need of combating COVID-19, researchers have put significant efforts in developing pharmaceutical solutions (e.g. vaccine), modelling and analysing the disease spread patterns for effective preventive measures. It is absolutely necessary to develop an analytics framework by extracting and incorporating the knowledge of heterogeneous data-sources to deliver insights in improving administrative policy and enhance the preparedness to combat the pandemic. Specifically, human mobility, travel history and other transport statistics have significant impacts on the spread of infectious disease. In this direction, this paper proposes a spatio-temporal knowledge mining framework to model the impact of human mobility and other contextual information over large geographic area in different temporal scales. The framework has three salient features, namely, (i) COVID-knowledge graph to discover correlations among mobility information and disease spread; (ii) Deep learning architecture to predict the next hot-spot zones; and (iii) providing necessary support in home-health monitoring utilizing Femtolet and fog/edge based solutions. The experimental evaluations on real-life datasets related to India illustrate the efficacy of the proposed methods.",

    "abstract": "The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has claimed the lives of over one million people and infected more than thirty-five million people worldwide. Several search engines have surfaced to provide researchers with additional tools to find and retrieve information from the rapidly growing corpora on COVID19. These engines lack extraction and visualization tools necessary to retrieve and interpret complex relations inherent to scientific literature. Moreover, because these engines mainly rely upon semantic information, their ability to capture complex global relationships across documents is limited, which reduces the quality of similarity-based article recommendations for users. In this work, we present the COVID-19 Knowledge Graph (CKG), a heterogeneous graph for extracting and visualizing complex relationships between COVID-19 scientific articles. The CKG combines semantic information with document topological information for the application of similar document retrieval. The CKG is constructed using the latent schema of the data, and then enriched with biomedical entity information extracted from the unstructured text of articles using scalable AWS technologies to form relations in the graph. Finally, we propose a document similarity engine that leverages low-dimensional graph embeddings from the CKG with semantic embeddings for similar article retrieval. Analysis demonstrates the quality of relationships in the CKG and shows that it can be used to uncover meaningful information in COVID-19 scientific articles. The CKG helps power www.cord19.aws and is publicly available.",

Existing literature and knowledge platforms on COVID-19 only focus on collecting papers on biology and medicine, neglecting the interdisciplinary efforts, which hurdles knowledge sharing and research collaborations between fields to address the problem. Studying interdisciplinary researches requires effective paper category classification and efficient cross-domain knowledge extraction and integration. In this work, we propose Covidia, COVID-19 interdisciplinary academic knowledge graph to bridge the gap between knowledge of COVID-19 on different domains. We design frameworks based on contrastive learning for disciplinary classification, and propose a new academic knowledge graph scheme for entity extraction, relation classification and ontology management in accordance with interdisciplinary researches. Based on Covidia, we also establish knowledge discovery benchmarks for finding COVID-19 research communities and predicting potential links.",

    "abstract": "Neurosymbolic AI is an increasingly active area of research which aims to combine symbolic reasoning methods with deep learning to generate models with both high predictive performance and some degree of human-level comprehensibility. As knowledge graphs are becoming a popular way to represent heterogeneous and multi-relational data, methods for reasoning on graph structures have attempted to follow this neurosymbolic paradigm. Traditionally, such approaches have utilized either rule-based inference or generated representative numerical embeddings from which patterns could be extracted. However, several recent studies have attempted to bridge this dichotomy in ways that facilitate interpretability, maintain performance, and integrate expert knowledge. Within this article, we survey a breadth of methods that perform neurosymbolic reasoning tasks on graph structures. To better compare the various methods, we propose a novel taxonomy by which we can classify them. Specifically, we propose three major categories: (1) logically-informed embedding approaches, (2) embedding approaches with logical constraints, and (3) rule-learning approaches. Alongside the taxonomy, we provide a tabular overview of the approaches and links to their source code, if available, for more direct comparison. Finally, we discuss the applications on which these methods were primarily used and propose several prospective directions toward which this new field of research could evolve.",

The construction used open-source tools to extract entities, relations and triples. Then, the COVID-19 KG is evaluated on three data-quality dimensions: correctness, relatedness and comprehensiveness, using a semiautomatic approach. Finally, this study assesses the application of the KG by building a question answering (Q&A) system. Five queries regarding COVID-19 genomes, symptoms, transmissions and therapeutics were submitted to the system and the results were analyzed.\n\n\nFindings\nWith current extraction tools, the quality of the KG is moderate and difficult to improve, unless more efforts are made to improve the tools for entity extraction, relation extraction and others. This study finds that comprehensiveness and relatedness positively correlate with the data size. Furthermore, the results indicate the performances of the Q&A systems built on the larger-scale KGs are better than the smaller ones for most queries, proving the importance of relatedness and comprehensiveness to ensure the usefulness of the KG.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThe KG construction process, data-quality-based and application-based evaluations discussed in this paper provide valuable references for KG researchers and practitioners to build high-quality domain-specific knowledge discovery systems.\n",

Our work offers an all-in-one scalable solution for extracting and exploring complex information from large-scale research documents, which would otherwise be tedious. First, we briefly explain our knowledge synthesis process to extract helpful information from unstructured text data of research documents. Then, on top of the knowledge extracted from the documents, we perform complex information retrieval using three major components- Paragraph Retrieval, Triplet Retrieval from Knowledge Graphs, and Complex Question Answering (QA). These components combine lexical and semantic-based methods to retrieve paragraphs and triplets and perform faceted refinement for filtering these search results. The complexity of biomedical queries and documents necessitates using a QA system capable of handling queries more complex than factoid queries, which we evaluate qualitatively on the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) to demonstrate the effectiveness and value-add.",

In this paper, we provide a systematic review of existing KGE techniques based on representation spaces. Particularly, we build a fine-grained classification to categorise the models based on three mathematical perspectives of the representation spaces: (1) Algebraic perspective, (2) Geometric perspective, and (3) Analytical perspective. We introduce the rigorous definitions of fundamental mathematical spaces before diving into KGE models and their mathematical properties. We further discuss different KGE methods over the three categories, as well as summarise how spatial advantages work over different embedding needs. By collating the experimental results from downstream tasks, we also explore the advantages of mathematical space in different scenarios and the reasons behind them. We further state some promising research directions from a representation space perspective, with which we hope to inspire researchers to design their KGE models as well as their related applications with more consideration of their mathematical space properties.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies in machine learning have demonstrated the effectiveness of applying graph neural networks (GNNs) to single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to predict COVID-19 disease states. In this study, we propose a graph attention capsule network (GACapNet) which extracts and fuses Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transcriptomic patterns to improve node classification performance on cells and genes. Significantly different from the existing GNN approaches, we innovatively incorporate a capsule layer with dynamic routing into our model architecture to combine and fuse gene features effectively and to allow those more prominent gene features present in the output. We evaluate our GACapNet model on two scRNA-seq datasets, and the experimental results show that our GACapNet model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models. Therefore, our study demonstrates the capability of advanced machine learning models to generate predictive features and evolutionary patterns of the SARS-CoV-2 pathogen, and the applicability of closing knowledge gaps in the pathogenesis and recovery of COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "With the development of pre-trained language models, many prompt-based approaches to data-efficient knowledge graph construction have been proposed and achieved impressive performance. However, existing prompt-based learning methods for knowledge graph construction are still susceptible to several potential limitations: (i) semantic gap between natural language and output structured knowledge with pre-defined schema, which means model cannot fully exploit semantic knowledge with the constrained templates; (ii) representation learning with locally individual instances limits the performance given the insufficient features, which are unable to unleash the potential analogical capability of pre-trained language models. Motivated by these observations, we propose a retrieval-augmented approach, which retrieves schema-aware Reference As Prompt (RAP), for data-efficient knowledge graph construction. It can dynamically leverage schema and knowledge inherited from human-annotated and weak-supervised data as a prompt for each sample, which is model-agnostic and can be plugged into widespread existing approaches. Experimental results demonstrate that previous methods integrated with RAP can achieve impressive performance gains in low-resource settings on five datasets of relational triple extraction and event extraction for knowledge graph construction.

    "abstract": "The emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had a significant impact on healthcare and the economy. With representation learning applied in constructing COVID-19 knowledge graphs, abundant COVID-19-related knowledge collected by clinicians and scientists all over the world can be utilized to deepen their understanding of the mechanism and related biological functions of the disease. However, most existing representation learning models cannot deal well with COVID-19 knowledge graph due to its low-connected star-like structure and various complex nonlinear relationships. Besides, lacking reliable negative triplets is also a difficult problem, yet to be adequately resolved. In this article, we propose a novel representation learning model called translation on hyperplanes with an activation operation and similar semantic sampling (SimH) for COVID-19 knowledge graphs. In our proposed SimH, an activation operation is designed to provide additional interaction features for low-in-degree entities. Then the hyperplane projection technique is introduced to the distance-based scoring function so that those complex nonlinear relationships can be modeled with lower complexity maintained in comparison with other nonlinear models. Moreover, a negative triplet sampling method that adaptively replaces entities with similar semantics is introduced to generate reliable negative triplets. To verify the effectiveness of SimH, extensive experiments are conducted on the COVID-19-Concepts dataset. The experimental results show that our SimH model achieves significant improvements in prediction and classification accuracy over existing knowledge representation learning models.",

Small- and macro- molecules that were not modeled as graphs also saw a bloom in GNN-based algorithms improving the state-of-the-art performance for learning their properties. Comparing to graph ML applications from other domains, life sciences offer many unique problems and nuances ranging from graph construction to graph- level, and bi-graph-level supervision tasks. The objective of this tutorial is twofold. First, it will provide a comprehensive overview of the types of biomedical graphs/networks, the underlying biological and medical problems, and the applications of graph ML algorithms for solving those problems. Second, it will showcase four concrete GNN solutions in life sciences with hands-on experience for the attendees. These hands-on sessions will cover: 1) training and fine-tuning GNN models for small-molecule property prediction on atomic graphs, 2) macro-molecule property and function prediction on residue graphs, 3) bi-graph based bind- ing affinity prediction for protein-ligand pairs, and 4) organizing and generating new knowledge for drug discovery and repurposing with knowledge graphs. This tutorial will also instruct the attendees to develop in two extensions of the software library Deep Graph Library (DGL), including DGL-lifesci and DGL-KE, so that they could jumpstart their own graph ML journey to advance life science research and development.",

This surge prompted the creation of multiple literature exploration systems to help automate the exploration of scientific articles. In this work, we survey multiple COVID-19 literature exploration systems by exploring their most discriminative characteristics, give general design principles for these systems, and describe some of their limitations. Abstract The urgency of the COVID-19 pandemic caused a surge in the related scientific literature. This surge made the manual exploration of scientific articles time-consuming and inefficient. Therefore, a range of exploratory search applications have been created to facilitate access to the available literature. In this survey, we give a short description of certain efforts in this direction and explore the different approaches that they used.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances have witnessed a growth of herbalism studies adopting a modern scientific approach in molecular medicine, offering valuable domain knowledge that can potentially boost the development of herbalism with evidence-supported efficacy and safety. However, these domain-specific scientific findings have not been systematically organized, affecting the efficiency of knowledge discovery and usage. Existing knowledge graphs in herbalism mainly focus on diagnosis and treatment with an absence of knowledge connection with molecular medicine. To fill this gap, we present HerbKG, a knowledge graph that bridges herbal and molecular medicine. The core bio-entities of HerbKG include herbs, chemicals extracted from the herbs, genes that are affected by the chemicals, and diseases treated by herbs due to the functions of genes. We have developed a learning framework to automate the process of HerbKG construction. The resulting HerbKG, after analyzing over 500K PubMed abstracts, is populated with 53K relations, providing extensive herbal-molecular domain knowledge in support of downstream applications. The code and an interactive tool are available at https://github.com/FeiYee/HerbKG.",

    "abstract": "The significance of research on public opinion monitoring of social network emergencies is becoming increasingly important. As a platform for users to communicate and share information online, social networks are often the source of public opinion about emergencies. Considering the relevance and transmissibility of the same event in different social networks, this paper takes the COVID-19 outbreak as the background and selects the platforms Weibo and TikTok as the research objects. In this paper, first, we use the transfer learning model to apply the knowledge obtained in the source domain of Weibo to the target domain of TikTok. From the perspective of text information, we propose an improved TC-LDA model to measure the similarity between the two domains, including temporal similarity and conceptual similarity, which effectively improves the learning effect of instance transfer and makes up for the problem of insufficient sample data in the target domain. Then, based on the results of transfer learning, we use the improved single-pass incremental clustering algorithm to discover and filter popular topics in streaming data of social networks. Finally, we build a topic knowledge graph using the Neo4j graph database and conduct experiments to predict the evolution of popular topics in new emergencies. Our research results can provide a reference for public opinion monitoring and early warning of emergencies in government departments.",

    "abstract": "The proliferation of social media has promoted the spread of misinformation that raises many concerns in our society. This paper focuses on a critical problem of explainable COVID-19 misinformation detection that aims to accurately identify and explain misleading COVID-19 claims on social media. Motivated by the lack of COVID-19 relevant knowledge in existing solutions, we construct a novel crowdsource knowledge graph based approach to incorporate the COVID-19 knowledge facts by leveraging the collaborative efforts of expert and non-expert crowd workers. Two important challenges exist in developing our solution: i) how to effectively coordinate the crowd efforts from both expert and non-expert workers to generate the relevant knowledge facts for detecting COVID-19 misinformation; ii) How to leverage the knowledge facts from the constructed knowledge graph to accurately explain the detected COVID-19 misinformation. To address the above challenges, we develop HC-COVID, a hierarchical crowdsource knowledge graph based framework that explicitly models the COVID-19 knowledge facts contributed by crowd workers with different levels of expertise and accurately identifies the related knowledge facts to explain the detection results. We evaluate HC-COVID using two public real-world datasets on social media. Evaluation results demonstrate that HC-COVID significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of the detection accuracy of misleading COVID-19 claims and the quality of the explanations.",

Computational approaches have been ubiquitously used in an attempt to timely and effectively cope with the resulting global health crisis. In order to extensively assess such contribution, we collected, categorized and prioritized over 17 000 COVID-19-related research articles including both peer-reviewed and preprint publications that make a relevant use of computational approaches. Using machine learning methods, we identified six broad application areas i.e. Molecular Pharmacology and Biomarkers, Molecular Virology, Epidemiology, Healthcare, Clinical Medicine and Clinical Imaging. We then used our prioritization model as a guidance through an extensive, systematic review of the most relevant studies. We believe that the remarkable contribution provided by computational applications during the ongoing pandemic motivates additional efforts toward their further development and adoption, with the aim of enhancing preparedness and critical response for current and future emergencies.",

    "abstract": "Drug discovery and development is a complex and costly process. Machine learning approaches are being investigated to help improve the effectiveness and speed of multiple stages of the drug discovery pipeline. Of these, those that use Knowledge Graphs (KG) have promise in many tasks, including drug repurposing, drug toxicity prediction and target gene-disease prioritization. In a drug discovery KG, crucial elements including genes, diseases and drugs are represented as entities, while relationships between them indicate an interaction. However, to construct high-quality KGs, suitable data are required. In this review, we detail publicly available sources suitable for use in constructing drug discovery focused KGs. We aim to help guide machine learning and KG practitioners who are interested in applying new techniques to the drug discovery field, but who may be unfamiliar with the relevant data sources. The datasets are selected via strict criteria, categorized according to the primary type of information contained within and are considered based upon what information could be extracted to build a KG. We then present a comparative analysis of existing public drug discovery KGs and an evaluation of selected motivating case studies from the literature. Additionally, we raise numerous and unique challenges and issues associated with the domain and its datasets, while also highlighting key future research directions. We hope this review will motivate KGs use in solving key and emerging questions in the drug discovery domain.",

    "abstract": "Covid-19 is an unprecedented challenge that disruptively reshapes societies and scientific research communities. Facing the knowledge flood brought by the overwhelming volume of research efforts, there still lacks a platform to link those to previous knowledge foundations and efficiently visualize and understand them. Aiming to fill this gap, we propose a research framework in this paper to assist scientists in identifying, retrieving, and visualizing the emerging Covid-19 knowledge. The proposed framework incorporates principal topic decomposition (PCD), text analytics-based knowledge model (KM), and the hierarchical topic tree (HTT) method to profile the research landscape, retrieve knowledge of specific interest, and visualize the knowledge structures. Initially, our topic analysis of 127, 971 research papers published during 2020-2021 identified 35 research hotspots. Furthermore, we built up a knowledge model on the topic of vaccination and retrieved 92, 286 research papers from the entire PubMed database as the knowledge foundation of this topic. Lastly, the HTT results of the retrieved papers highlighted multiple relevant disciplines, from whose branches we identified four future research directions: Monoclonal antibody treatments, vaccination in diabetic patients, vaccination effectiveness in SARS-CoV-2 antigenic drift, and vaccination-related allergic sensitization. \u00a9 Copyright 2022 for this paper by its authors.",

There is a strong need to develop community-accessible datasets to train existing AI-based cybersecurity pipelines to efficiently and accurately extract meaningful insights from CTI. We have created an initial unstructured CTI corpus from a variety of open sources that we are using to train and test cybersecurity entity models using the spaCy framework and exploring self-learning methods to automatically recognize cybersecurity entities. We also describe methods to apply cybersecurity domain entity linking with existing world knowledge from Wikidata.

    "abstract": "The origin of the COVID-19 pandemic has given overture to redirection, as well as innovation to many digital technologies. Even after the progression of vaccination efforts across the globe, total eradication of this pandemic is still a distant future due to the evolution of new variants. To proactively deal with the pandemic, the health care service providers and the caretaker organizations require new technologies, alongside with improvements in existing related technologies, Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Machine Learning in terms of infrastructure, efficiency, privacy, and security. This paper provides an overview of current theoretical and application prospects of IoT, AI, cloud computing, edge computing, deep learning techniques, blockchain technologies, social networks, robots, machines, privacy, and security techniques. In consideration of these prospects in intersection with COVID-19 pandemic, we reviewed the technologies within the broad umbrella of AI-IoT technologies in the most concise classification scheme. In this review, we illustrated that AI-IoT technological applications and innovations have most impacted the field of healthcare. The essential AI-IoT technologies found for healthcare were fog computing in IoT, deep learning, and blockchain. Furthermore, we highlighted several aspects of these technologies and their future impact with a novel methodology of using techniques from image processing, machine learning and differential system modeling.",

    "title": "Suspicious Sentence Detection and Claim Verification in the COVID-19 Domain",
    "abstract": "The processing, identification and fact checking of online information has received a lot of attention recently. One of the challenges is that scandalous or \"blown up\"news tend to become viral, even when coming from unreliable sources. Particularly during a global pandemic, it is crucial to find efficient ways of determining the credibility of information. Fact-checking initiatives such as Snopes, FactCheck.org etc., perform manual claim validation but they are unable to cover all suspicious claims that can be found online - they focus mainly on the ones that have gone viral. Similarly, for the general user it is also impossible to fact-check every single statement on a specific topic. While a lot of research has been carried out in both claim verification and fact-check-worthiness, little work has been done so far on the detection and extraction of dubious claims, combined with fact-checking them using external knowledge bases, especially in the COVID-19 domain. Our approach involves a two-step claim verification procedure consisting of a fake news detection task in the form of binary sequence classification and fact-checking using the Google Fact Check Tools. We primarily work on medium-sized documents in the English language. Our prototype is able to recognize, on a higher level, the nature of fake news, even hidden in a text that seems credible at first glance. This way we can alert the reader that a document contains suspicious statements, even if no already validated similar claims exist. For more popular claims, however, multiple results are found and displayed. We manage to achieve an F1 score of 98.03% and an accuracy of 98.1% in the binary fake news detection task using a fine-tuned DistilBERT model. \u00a9 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.",

    "abstract": "The use of knowledge graphs as a data source for machine learning methods to solve complex problems in life sciences has rapidly become popular in recent years. Our Biological Insights Knowledge Graph (BIKG) combines relevant data for drug development from public as well as internal data sources to provide insights for a range of tasks: from identifying new targets to repurposing existing drugs. Besides the common requirements to organisational knowledge graphs such as being able to capture the domain precisely and give the users the ability to search and query the data, the focus on handling multiple use cases and supporting use case-specific machine learning models presents additional challenges: the data models must also be streamlined for the performance of downstream tasks; graph content must be easily customisable for different use cases; different projections of the graph content are required to support a wider range of different consumption modes. In this paper we describe our main design choices in implementation of the BIKG graph and discuss different aspects of its life cycle: from graph construction to exploitation.",

    "abstract": "The $\\beta$-model is a powerful tool for modeling network generation driven by degree heterogeneity. Its simple yet expressive nature particularly well-suits large and sparse networks, where many network models become infeasible due to computational challenge and observation scarcity. However, existing estimation algorithms for $\\beta$-model do not scale up; and theoretical understandings remain limited to dense networks. This paper brings several significant improvements to the method and theory of $\\beta$-model to address urgent needs of practical applications. Our contributions include: 1. method: we propose a new $\\ell_2$ penalized MLE scheme; we design a novel fast algorithm that can comfortably handle sparse networks of millions of nodes, much faster and more memory-parsimonious than all existing algorithms; 2. theory: we present new error bounds on $\\beta$-models under much weaker assumptions than best known results in literature; we also establish new lower-bounds and new asymptotic normality results; under proper parameter sparsity assumptions, we show the first local rate-optimality result in $\\ell_2$ norm; distinct from existing literature, our results cover both small and large regularization scenarios and reveal their distinct asymptotic dependency structures; 3. application: we apply our method to large COVID-19 network data sets and discover meaningful results.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 is having a dramatic impact on research and researchers. The pandemic has underlined the severity of known challenges in research and surfaced new ones, but also accelerated the adoption of innovations and manifested new opportunities. This review considers early trends emerging from meta-research on COVID-19. In particular, it focuses on the following topics: i) mapping COVID-19 research;ii) data and machine learning;iii) research practices including open access and open data, reviewing, publishing and funding;iv) communicating research to the public;v) the impact of COVID-19 on researchers, in particular with respect to gender and career trajectories. This overview finds that most early meta-research on COVID-19 has been reactive and focused on short-term questions, while more recently a shift to consider the long-term consequences of COVID-19 is taking place. Based on these findings, the author speculates that some aspects of doing research during COVID-19 are more likely to persist than others. These include: the shift to virtual for academic events such as conferences;the use of openly accessible pre-prints;the `datafication' of scholarly literature and consequent broader adoption of machine learning in science communication;the public visibility of research and researchers on social and online media.",

    "abstract": "Incorporating external knowledge into Named Entity Recognition (NER) systems has been widely studied in the generic domain. In this paper, we focus on clinical domain where only limited data is accessible and interpretability is important. Recent advancement in technology and the acceleration of clinical trials has resulted in the discovery of new drugs, procedures as well as medical conditions. These factors motivate towards building robust zero-shot NER systems which can quickly adapt to new medical terminology. We propose an auxiliary gazetteer model and fuse it with an NER system, which results in better robustness and interpretability across different clinical datasets. Our gazetteer based fusion model is data efficient, achieving +1.7 micro-F1 gains on the i2b2 dataset using 20% training data, and brings + 4.7 micro-F1 gains on novel entity mentions never presented during training. Moreover, our fusion model is able to quickly adapt to new mentions in gazetteers without re-training and the gains from the proposed fusion model are transferable to related datasets.",

    "abstract": "Medical entity retrieval is an integral component for understanding and communicating information across various health systems. Current approaches tend to work well on specific medical domains but generalize poorly to unseen sub-specialties. This is of increasing concern under a public health crisis as new medical conditions and drug treatments come to light frequently. Zero-shot retrieval is challenging due to the high degree of ambiguity and variability in medical corpora, making it difficult to build an accurate similarity measure between mentions and concepts. Medical knowledge graphs (KG), however, contain rich semantics including large numbers of synonyms as well as its curated graphical structures. To take advantage of this valuable information, we propose a suite of learning tasks designed for training efficient zero-shot entity retrieval models. Without requiring any human annotation, our knowledge graph enriched architecture significantly outperforms common zero-shot benchmarks including BM25 and Clinical BERT with 7% to 30% higher recall across multiple major medical ontologies, such as UMLS, SNOMED and ICD-10.",

    "abstract": "Background: Searching through the COVID-19 research literature to gain actionable clinical insight is a formidable task, even for experts. The usefulness of this corpus in terms of improving patient care is tied to the ability to see the big picture that emerges when the studies are seen in conjunction rather than in isolation. When the answer to a search query requires linking together multiple pieces of information across documents, simple keyword searches are insufficient. To answer such complex information needs, an innovative artificial intelligence (AI) technology named a knowledge graph (KG) could prove to be effective. Methods: We conducted an exploratory literature review of KG applications in the context of COVID-19. The search term used was \u201ccovid-19 knowledge graph\u201d. In addition to PubMed, the first five pages of search results for Google Scholar and Google were considered for inclusion. Google Scholar was used to include non-peer-reviewed or non-indexed articles such as pre-prints and conference proceedings. Google was used to identify companies or consortiums active in this domain that have not published any literature, peer-reviewed or otherwise. Results: Our search yielded 34 results on PubMed and 50 results each on Google and Google Scholar. We found KGs being used for facilitating literature search, drug repurposing, clinical trial mapping, and risk factor analysis. Conclusions: Our synopses of these works make a compelling case for the utility of this nascent field of research.",

    "abstract": "In sponsored search, retrieving synonymous keywords for exact match type is important for accurately targeted advertising. Datadriven deep learning-based method has been proposed to tackle this problem. An apparent disadvantage of this method is its poor generalization performance on entity-level long-tail instances, even though they might share similar concept-level patterns with frequent instances. With the help of a large knowledge base, we find that most commercial synonymous query-keyword pairs can be abstracted into meaningful conceptual patterns through concept tagging. Based on this fact, we propose a novel knowledge-driven conceptual retrieval framework to mitigate this problem, which consists of three parts: data conceptualization, matching via conceptual patterns and concept-augmented discrimination. Both offline and online experiments show that our method is very effective. This framework has been successfully applied to Baidu\u2019s sponsored search system, which yields a significant improvement in revenue.",

    "abstract": "In 2020, the White House released the, \u201cCall to Action to the Tech Community on New Machine Readable COVID-19 Dataset,\u201d wherein artificial intelligence experts are asked to collect data and develop text mining techniques that can help the science community answer high-priority scientific questions related to COVID-19. The Allen Institute for AI and collaborators announced the availability of a rapidly growing open dataset of publications, the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19). As the pace of research accelerates, biomedical scientists struggle to stay current. To expedite their investigations, scientists leverage hypothesis generation systems, which can automatically inspect published papers to discover novel implicit connections. We present an automated general purpose hypothesis generation systems AGATHA-C and AGATHA-GP for COVID-19 research. The systems are based on graph-mining and the transformer model. The systems are massively validated using retrospective information rediscovery and proactive analysis involving human-in-the-loop expert analysis. Both systems achieve high-quality predictions across domains (in some domains up to 0.97% ROC AUC) in fast computational time and are released to the broad scientific community to accelerate biomedical research. In addition, by performing the domain expert curated study, we show that the systems are able to discover on-going research findings such as the relationship between COVID-19 and oxytocin hormone.

    "abstract": "Abstract More than 50 000 papers have been published about COVID-19 since the beginning of 2020 and several hundred new papers continue to be published every day. This incredible rate of scientific productivity leads to information overload, making it difficult for researchers, clinicians and public health officials to keep up with the latest findings. Automated text mining techniques for searching, reading and summarizing papers are helpful for addressing information overload. In this review, we describe the many resources that have been introduced to support text mining applications over the COVID-19 literature; specifically, we discuss the corpora, modeling resources, systems and shared tasks that have been introduced for COVID-19. We compile a list of 39 systems that provide functionality such as search, discovery, visualization and summarization over the COVID-19 literature. For each system, we provide a qualitative description and assessment of the system\u2019s performance, unique data or user interface features and modeling decisions. Many systems focus on search and discovery, though several systems provide novel features, such as the ability to summarize findings over multiple documents or linking between scientific articles and clinical trials. We also describe the public corpora, models and shared tasks that have been introduced to help reduce repeated effort among community members; some of these resources (especially shared tasks) can provide a basis for comparing the performance of different systems. Finally, we summarize promising results and open challenges for text mining the COVID-19 literature.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has spawned a diverse body of scientific literature that is challenging to navigate, stimulating interest in automated tools to help find useful knowledge. We pursue the construction of a knowledge base (KB) of mechanisms\u2014a fundamental concept across the sciences, which encompasses activities, functions and causal relations, ranging from cellular processes to economic impacts. We extract this information from the natural language of scientific papers by developing a broad, unified schema that strikes a balance between relevance and breadth. We annotate a dataset of mechanisms with our schema and train a model to extract mechanism relations from papers. Our experiments demonstrate the utility of our KB in supporting interdisciplinary scientific search over COVID-19 literature, outperforming the prominent PubMed search in a study with clinical experts. Our search engine, dataset and code are publicly available.",

These articles, along with earlier related literature, compose a valuable knowledge base affecting contemporary research studies, or even government actions to limit the spread of the disease and treatment decisions taken by physicians. However, the number of such articles is increasing at an intense rate making the exploration of the relevant literature and the identification of useful knowledge in it challenging. In this work, we describe BIP4COVID19, an open dataset compiled to facilitate the coronavirus-related literature exploration, by providing various indicators of scientific impact for the relevant articles. Additionally, we provide a publicly accessible Web interface on top of our data, allowing the exploration of the publications based on the computed indicators.",

    "abstract": "The $\u03b2$-model is a powerful tool for modeling network generation driven by node degree heterogeneity. Its simple yet expressive nature particularly well-suits large and sparse networks, where many network models become infeasible due to computational challenge and observation scarcity. However, existing estimation algorithms for $\u03b2$-model do not scale up;and theoretical understandings remain limited to dense networks. This paper brings several major improvements to the method and theory of $\u03b2$-model to address urgent needs of practical applications. Our contributions include: 1. method: we propose a new $\\ell_2$ penalized MLE scheme;we design a novel algorithm that can comfortably handle sparse networks of millions of nodes, much faster and more memory-parsimonious than any existing algorithm;2. theory: we present new error bounds on beta-models under much weaker assumptions;we also establish new lower-bounds and new asymptotic normality results;distinct from existing literature, our results cover both small and large regularization scenarios and reveal their distinct asymptotic dependency structures;3. application: we apply our method to large COVID-19 network data sets and discover meaningful results.",

Searching through the COVID-19 research literature to gain actionable clinical insight is a formidable task, even for experts. The usefulness of this corpus in terms of improving patient care is tied to the ability to see the big picture that emerges when the studies are seen in conjunction rather than in isolation. When the answer to a search query requires linking together multiple pieces of information across documents, simple keyword searches are insufficient. To answer such complex information needs, an innovative AI technology called a knowledge graph (KG) could prove to be effective. abstract, and tagging information. The superiority of Google Scholar over PubMed with respect to the ability to retrieve relevant articles using a quick search has been studied before. The advantages of PubMed over Google Scholar, which mainly stem from PubMed using human curation, are irrelevant for this review, because the sources identified by Google Scholar are perused by us before inclusion in the results. It would be unacceptable to use Google Scholar for a systematic review because the process must be repeatable, and human judgement used for quality evaluation is subjective (and thus not repeatable). However, for an exploratory review, this does not pose a problem, and using Google Scholar allows access to a larger number of sources (sometimes referred to as \u2018grey literature\u2019). An up-to-date comparison of these different search approaches from the perspective of a librarian can be found elsewhere. especially given its once-daily oral dosing and acceptable side-effect profile. In addition, the potential for combination therapy with baricitinib was high, including combining baricitinib with the direct-acting antivirals (lopinavir or ritonavir and remdesivir) currently being used in the COVID-19 outbreak to reduce viral infectivity, viral replication, and the aberrant host inflammatory response. This work demonstrates that a KG can facilitate rapid drug development. A trial of baricitinib plus remdesivir has already been conducted and was superior to remdesivir alone in reducing recovery time and accelerating improvement in clinical status.",

    "title": "Open Information Extraction in Digital Libraries: Current Challenges and Open Research Questions",
    "abstract": "A central challenge for digital libraries is to provide effective access paths to ever-growing collections of mostly textual, i.e., unstructured information. The traditional, yet expensive way to manage, categorize, and annotate such collections is extensive manual metadata curation to semantically enrich library items. The ability to convert textual information automatically into a structured representation would be extremely beneficial, allowing for novel access paths as well as supporting semantically meaningful discovery. This paper investigates opportunities and challenges that the latest techniques for open information extraction offer for digital libraries. Open information extraction promises to work out-of-the-box and does not require domain-specific training data. To evaluate how well such tools perform, we perform a qualitative evaluation in two domains: general news and biomedicine. Our research shows current benefits, but also reveals serious challenges for practical applications. In particular three research questions still have to be addressed to reliably use open information extraction in digital library projects.",

    "abstract": "The application of transformer-based contextual representations has became a de facto solution for solving complex NLP tasks. Despite their successes, such representations are arguably opaque as their latent dimensions are not directly interpretable. To alleviate this limitation of contextual representations, we devise such an algorithm where the output representation expresses human-interpretable information of each dimension. We achieve this by constructing a transformation matrix based on the semantic content of the embedding space and predefined semantic categories using Hellinger distance. We evaluate our inferred representations on supersense prediction task. Our experiments reveal that the interpretable nature of transformed contextual representations makes it possible to accurately predict the supersense category of a word by simply looking for its transformed coordinate with the largest coefficient. We quantify the effects of our proposed transformation when applied over traditional dense contextual embeddings. We additionally investigate and report consistent improvements for the integration of sparse contextual word representations into our proposed algorithm.",

    "abstract": "Biomedical Information Extraction from scientific literature presents two unique and non-trivial challenges. First, compared with general natural language texts, sentences from scientific papers usually possess wider contexts between knowledge elements. Moreover, comprehending the fine-grained scientific entities and events urgently requires domain-specific background knowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel biomedical Information Extraction (IE) model to tackle these two challenges and extract scientific entities and events from English research papers. We perform Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) to compress the wide context to uncover a clear semantic structure for each complex sentence. Besides, we construct the sentence-level knowledge graph from an external knowledge base and use it to enrich the AMR graph to improve the model\u2019s understanding of complex scientific concepts. We use an edge-conditioned graph attention network to encode the knowledge-enriched AMR graph for biomedical IE tasks. Experiments on the GENIA 2011 dataset show that the AMR and external knowledge have contributed 1.8% and 3.0% absolute F-score gains respectively. In order to evaluate the impact of our approach on real-world problems that involve topic-specific fine-grained knowledge elements, we have also created a new ontology and annotated corpus for entity and event extraction for the COVID-19 scientific literature, which can serve as a new benchmark for the biomedical IE community.",

    "abstract": "Semantic knowledge graphs provide very significant benefits for structuring and analysing huge amounts of aggregated data across diverse heterogeneous sources. Beyond quick and efficient data query and analysis, they facilitate inference from data and generation of insights for several purposes. With the multi-faceted global challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, this research focused on the use of a semantic knowledge graph to model, structure and store COVID-related news articles centrally and semantically towards knowledge discovery, knowledge acquisition and advanced data analytics for understanding varying metrics relating to the virus towards curbing its spread. The semantic knowledge graph provides a platform for researchers, data analysts and data scientists across societal sectors to investigate and recommend strategies towards addressing the challenges it poses to the global society.",

    "abstract": "As scientists worldwide search for answers to the overwhelmingly unknown behind the deadly pandemic, the literature concerning COVID-19 has been growing exponentially. Keeping abreast of the body of literature at such a rapidly advancing pace poses significant challenges not only to active researchers but also to society as a whole. Although numerous data resources have been made openly available, the analytic and synthetic process that is essential in effectively navigating through the vast amount of information with heightened levels of uncertainty remains a significant bottleneck. We introduce a generic method that facilitates the data collection and sense-making process when dealing with a rapidly growing landscape of a research domain such as COVID-19 at multiple levels of granularity. The method integrates the analysis of structural and temporal patterns in scholarly publications with the delineation of thematic concentrations and the types of uncertainties that may offer additional insights into the complexity of the unknown. We demonstrate the application of the method in a study of the COVID-19 literature.",

    "abstract": "Cultivated land provides fundamental land-related resources, and its ecological security is, thus, an important means of protecting it. The ecological security of cultivated land has emerged as an important and challenging area of research in recent years. In this study, we summarize the progress in research on the evaluation of the ecological security of cultivated land through visual analysis. We review the concepts, characteristics, driving factors, scales and methods of evaluation, technologies, and simulations used in the relevant literature. The results show that while the relevant concept has been preliminarily established, research on the ecological security of cultivated land remains in its infancy, and comprehensive work on the subject is lacking. The Prevalent research has mainly focused on analyzing the current situation, but lacks a dynamic analysis of the driving mechanism of the ecological security of cultivated land based on simulations. This has made it difficult to understand the spatiotemporal mechanism of the ecological security of cultivated land. Future research in the area should discuss the complex driving mechanism of interactions between the social economy system and the ecological system and focus on an integrated model to assess its dynamic spatial and multi-scale characteristics of ecological security of cultivated land because this can inform the theory of protecting cultivated land and the design of plans for land use to mitigate global climate change.",

This scientometric study aimed to summarize the main research trends, identify current research hotspots, and measure the networks of the contributors and their scientific productivity. A total of 1102 publications regarding MSC in IDD were recognized from January 2000 to April 2022. The number of records every year followed an overall uptrend with fluctuations. The main trend of research demonstrated the practice of gradually applying MSC-based therapy to IDD with the assistance of advances in biomaterials and IDD pathology. A recent focus on MSC-derived exosomes and notochordal cells was detected. The basic studies in this field were mainly contributed to by Japan, the USA, and European countries, while China dominated in the number of recent publications. Tokai University with Daisuke Sakai was the most productive contributor. Cell biology, tissue engineering, and biomaterials were the categories with deep engagement in research of this field.",

    "abstract": "Background Colorectal cancer (CRC) has the third-highest incidence and second-highest mortality rate of all cancers worldwide. Early diagnosis and screening of CRC have been the focus of research in this field. With the continuous development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, AI has advantages in many aspects of CRC, such as adenoma screening, genetic testing, and prediction of tumor metastasis. Objective This study uses bibliometrics to analyze research in AI in CRC, summarize the field\u2019s history and current status of research, and predict future research directions. Method We searched the SCIE database for all literature on CRC and AI. The documents span the period 2002-2022. we used bibliometrics to analyze the data of these papers, such as authors, countries, institutions, and references. Co-authorship, co-citation, and co-occurrence analysis were the main methods of analysis. Citespace, VOSviewer, and SCImago Graphica were used to visualize the results. Result This study selected 1,531 articles on AI in CRC. China has published a maximum number of 580 such articles in this field. The U.S. had the most quality publications, boasting an average citation per article of 46.13. Mori Y and Ding K were the two authors with the highest number of articles. Scientific Reports, Cancers, and Frontiers in Oncology are this field\u2019s most widely published journals. Institutions from China occupy the top 9 positions among the most published institutions. We found that research on AI in this field mainly focuses on colonoscopy-assisted diagnosis, imaging histology, and pathology examination. Conclusion AI in CRC is currently in the development stage with good prospects. AI is currently widely used in colonoscopy, imageomics, and pathology. However, the scope of AI applications is still limited, and there is a lack of inter-institutional collaboration. The pervasiveness of AI technology is the main direction of future housing development in this field.",

    "abstract": "China has a well-developed active structure, with the continuous expansion of the scale of engineering construction and the continuous extension to the complex geological areas, especially the tectonic areas that are still active or will still be active in the future. Related projects are faced with many new challenges. The summative achievements on the problems related to active tectonics in China still need to be made available. This paper uses CNKI and WOS as data sources, and the documents related to active tectonics and geology from 2003 to 2022 are taken as objects. The scientific knowledge graph is visualized and analyzed by the bibliometrics software CiteSpace. The results show that: (1) the number of research literature on active tectonics at home and abroad is on the rise as a whole, (2) the number of articles published in the field of active tectonics in China is highly proportional to the number of earthquake disasters in China each year, and (3) the United States is in an absolute leading position in this field. It can help researchers in related fields to obtain the classical achievements of nearly 20 years quickly, and it is easy to find the bottleneck of current research. It can also expand the field of vision to find new research directions.",

    "title": "Bibliometric analysis of publication trends and research hotspots in vagus nerve stimulation: A 20-year panorama",
    "abstract": "Background As a promising neuromodulation technique, vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) has been utilized to treat diverse diseases and the number of VNS studies has grown prosperously. Nonetheless, publication trends and research hotspots in this field remain unknown. This study aimed to perform a bibliometric analysis to systematically identify publication trends and research hotspots in VNS research within a 20-year panorama. Methods The Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database was retrieved to screen eligible VNS-related publications from 2002 to 2021. The online analytic tool of the WoSCC database was used to analyze various bibliometric parameters, such as the number of annual publications, the output of countries/regions, journals, total citations, citations per publication, and the Hirsch index. Bibliometrics (http://bibliometric.com/) and CiteSpace (version 5.6.R3) were used to identify research trends and hotspots. Results A total of 7,283 publications were included for analysis. The annual number of publications increased stably but it increased significantly in recent years. The top five prolific countries were the United States, China, Germany, England, and France. The top five productive institutions were the University of California (Los Angeles), Harvard Medical School, Harvard University, University College London, and the University of Texas at Dallas. Notably, there was a geographical imbalance in countries and institutions. In addition, Epilepsy & Behavior, Epilepsia, and Plos One were the top three journals with the largest number of VNS publications. Michael P Kilgard was the most prolific author. Moreover, evolving research hotspots mainly included the effectiveness and mechanism of VNS on epilepsy, the role of VNS as an anti-inflammatory regulator, the application of VNS for psychiatric disorders, and the neuromodulation effect of VNS in headache management. Conclusion This study has revealed the overall publication trends and evolving research trends at a global level over a 20-year panorama. The potential collaborators, institutions, hotspots, and future research trends are also identified in this field, which will help guide new research directions of VNS.",

    "abstract": "While introducing new technology has completely transformed the textile production process, the rapid pace of massive industrialization has increased the volume of wastewater, which is highly hazardous. Even though the textile industry is essential to our economy, the textile industry is harmful to the environment because of the production of wastewater, solid wastes, air pollutants, noise, etc. Recycling textile wastewater is crucial, and oxidation, physical, biological, and physicochemical methods can be used to treat textile wastewater. Based on statistics and visualization tools, bibliometric analysis has evolved to demonstrate a given topic\u2019s knowledge structures and developmental tendencies. Here we provide a bibliometric analysis focused on textile wastewater treatment from 1990 to 2022. Raw data was retrieved from the Web of Science (WoS) database and mapped using VOSviewer and biblioshiny. Textile, wastewater, and treatment were keywords. We retrieved 8,170 documents, 1,138 sources published these documents, a 22.7% annual increase, where 21458 authors published these documents with an average citation rate of 33.2%, and there were 6,680 research articles and 462 review articles. DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT stayed on top with 422 publications. We discovered that DONGHUA UNIVERSITY ranks first with 330 publications. Though China took first place with a total of 43961 citations, followed by India with a total of 33953 citations, from a total of 120 countries participating in this research, the research work of CRINI G and coworkers was most cited globally. The most common term was wastewater, which occurred 3,144 times, followed by textile, which appeared 2,669 times. We expect this research to be a significant resource for scholars by comprehensively describing the current state and future directions of textile wastewater treatment.",

    "abstract": "Land subsidence is one of the serious natural disasters which can cause heavy casualties and economic losses. As a vital method, Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) can provide quick and efficient solutions for analysis. Currently, most reviews on InSAR application in land subsidence only focused on single types of land areas, such as the land around groundwater and land of the mining area. There is a lack of discussion on all types of land areas. This study thus aims at conducting a bibliometric literature analysis of the existing literature from 2000 to 2021 to fill this gap. The authors used scientific mapping methods to analyze the InSAR applications in land subsidence so that researchers and practitioners can comprehend the procedure. Then, the authors identified the major research areas, development milestones, evolutionary stages, and the transaction dynamics of evolutionary stages. Knowledge maps of five aspects were applied and analyzed in this research, including temporal development analysis, countries and institutions, major research disciplines, high-frequency terms, and cocitation of high-citation papers. The results reveal that the research of land subsidence monitoring with InSAR is in the stage of diffusion from developing many tools and techniques to integrating with other research areas. Overall, the bibliometric results combined with evolutionary stages provide a holistic picture of the status quo and future trends in InSAR application in land subsidence.",

    "title": "Comparative Study on International Research Hotspots and National-Level Policy Keywords of Dynamic Disaster Monitoring and Early Warning in China (2000\u20132021)",
    "abstract": "For more than 20 years, disaster dynamic monitoring and early warning have achieved orderly and sustainable development in China, forming a systematic academic research system and top-down policy design, which are inseparable from the research of China\u2019s scientific community and the promotion of government departments. In the past, most of the research on dynamic disaster monitoring and early warning focused on specific research in a certain field, scene, and discipline, while a few studies focused on research review or policy analysis, and few studies combined macro and meso research reviews in academia with national policy analysis for comparative analysis. It is necessary and urgent to explore the interaction between scholars\u2019 research and policy deployment, which can bring theoretical contributions and policy references to the top-down design, implementation promotion, and academic research of China\u2019s dynamic disaster monitoring and early warning. Based on 608 international research articles on dynamic disaster monitoring and early warning published by Chinese scholars from 2000\u20132021 and 187 national policy documents published during this period, this paper conducts a comparative analysis between the knowledge maps of international research hotspots and the co-occurrence maps of policy keywords on dynamic disaster monitoring and early warning. The research shows that in the stage of initial development (2000\u20132007), international research articles are few and focused, and research hotspots are somewhat alienated from policy keywords. In the stage of rising development (2008\u20132015), after the Wenchuan earthquake, research hotspots are closely related to policy keywords, mainly in the fields of geology, engineering disasters, meteorological disasters, natural disasters, etc. Meanwhile, research hotspots also focus on cutting-edge technologies and theories, while national-level policy keywords focus more on overall governance and macro promotion, but the two are gradually closely integrated. In the stage of rapid development (2016\u20132021), with the continuous attention and policy promotion of the national government, the establishment of the Ministry of Emergency Management, and the gradual establishment and improvement of the disaster early warning and monitoring system, research hotspots and policy keywords are integrated and overlapped with each other, realizing the organic linkage and mutual promotion between academic research and political deployment. The motivation, innovation, integration, and transformation of dynamic disaster monitoring and early warning are promoted by both policy and academic research. The institutions that issue policies at the national level include the State Council and relevant departments, the Ministry of Emergency Management, the Ministry of Water Resources, and other national ministries and commissions. The leading affiliated institutions of scholars\u2019 international research include China University of Mining and Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan University, Shandong University of Science and Technology, and other institutions. The disciplines involved are mainly multidisciplinary geosciences, environmental sciences, electrical and electronic engineering, remote sensing, etc. It is worth noting that in the past two to three years, research and policies focusing on COVID-19, public health, epidemic prevention, environmental governance, and emergency management have gradually increased.",

    "abstract": "Background Cancer chemotherapy resistance is one of the most critical obstacles in cancer therapy. Since Warburg O first observed alterations in cancer metabolism in the 1950s, people gradually found tumor metabolism pathways play a fundamental role in regulating the response to chemotherapeutic drugs, and the attempts of targeting tumor energetics have shown promising preclinical outcomes in recent years. This study aimed to summarize the knowledge structure and identify emerging trends and potential hotspots in metabolic signaling pathways of tumor drug resistance research. Methods Publications related to metabolic signaling pathways of tumor drug resistance published from 1992 to 2022 were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection database. The document type was set to articles or reviews with language restriction to English. Two different scientometric software including Citespace and VOS viewer were used to conduct this scientometric analysis. Results A total of 2,537 publications including 1,704 articles and 833 reviews were retrieved in the final analysis. The USA made the most contributions to this field. The leading institution was the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Avan A was the most productive author, and Hanahan D was the key researcher with the most co-citations, but there is no leader in this field yet. Cancers was the most influential academic journal, and Oncology was the most popular research field. Based on keywords occurrence analysis, these selected keywords could be roughly divided into five main topics: cluster 1 (study of cancer cell apoptosis pathway); cluster 2 (study of resistance mechanisms of different cancer types); cluster 3 (study of cancer stem cells); cluster 4 (study of tumor oxidative stress and inflammation signaling pathways); and cluster 5 (study of autophagy). The keywords burst detection identified several keywords as new research hotspots, including \u201ctumor microenvironment,\u201d \u201cinvasion,\u201d and \u201ctarget\u201d. Conclusion Tumor metabolic reprogramming of drug resistance research is advancing rapidly. This study serves as a starting point, providing a thorough overview, the development landscape, and future opportunities in this field.",

    "abstract": "For over three (3) decades, there has been an increase in research on energy sources from the production of oil using flexible marine risers, such as marine hoses. Marine hoses are conduits for special use as rubberized structures with hybrid polymer composites for offshore platforms in the oil and gas industry. This scientometric study uses qualitative, quantitative, and computational approaches. Data were retrieved using a research methodology that was created for this study using the SCOPUS and Web of Science (WoS) databases. This study provides a bibliometric literature review on marine hoses with an emphasis on the advancements made in the field from recent developments, geographical activity by countries, authorship histories, partnerships, funding sources, affiliations, co-occurrences, and potential research areas. The study found that the USA had the most publications, but there were fewer co-occurrences with connections outside the cluster. Due to the difficulty of adaptation, acceptability, qualification, and deployment of marine hoses in the offshore marine industry, this topic contains more conference papers than journal papers. Therefore, more funding sources and collaborations on marine hoses are required to advance the research. This study makes a contribution to scholarship on advances made in petroleum exploration and production for (un)loading hoses.",

    "title": "The denitrifying anaerobic methane oxidation process and microorganisms in the environments: A review",
    "abstract": "Methane (CH4) is an important greenhouse gas with a global warming potential 28 \u2013 34 times that of CO2 over the 100-year horizon. Denitrifying anaerobic methane oxidation (DAMO) is a recently discovered process that potentially represents an important CH4 sink globally. This process involves two possible pathways: the nitrite-dependent DAMO mediated by NC10 bacteria and the nitrate-dependent DAMO by ANME-2d archaea. Both are widely detected in freshwater and coastal habitats using molecular tools. However, the distributions of these two processes and the functional microorganisms and their interactions with other N cycling pathways are far from clear. In this review, we conducted a scientometric analysis on a co-citation network consisting of 835 references derived from 354 citing articles closely related to the distribution of DAMO in the environment. Through this analysis, we found that current studies focus more on freshwater systems than coastal systems, and ANME-2d archaea are generally under-studied compared to NC10 bacteria. The emerging research topics in this area include AMO processes coupled to alternative electron acceptors and their role as CH4 sinks. We further reviewed papers focusing on DAMO distribution in freshwater and coastal environments guided by the result of the scientometric analysis. Finally, we identified several areas that require further research and proposed future research including comparisons of DAMO with other N cycling pathways and environmental conditions in the context of the river-estuary-sea continuum.",

    "abstract": "Open data is a practical source for identifying disaster risks. However, few studies have examined open data usage. This study employed CiteSpace to conduct a bibliometric analysis to determine the evolution of open data in the field of disaster risk based on the literature. The findings were as follows: first, the existing disaster-related research can be classified into four categories: introduction to risk management and its concepts, multi-hazard response, studies on the specific background or context, and analysis of the technology or methods used in disaster risk reduction. Second, the relevant literature first emerged in 1997 and has rapidly expanded in recent years. Top keywords were identified, such as \u201cnatural disaster,\u201d \u201crisk,\u201d and \u201cclimate change.\u201d Third, the most productive country in terms of publications has been the People\u2019s Republic of China; however, the low centrality indicates a lack of international collaborations. Fourth, several bursts were found in the collected literature. The term \u201cdata analysis\u201d appears to be one of the most pressing concerns. Finally, we identified the research frontiers. The topic \u201caccessible global dataset\u201d has been of primary interest to researchers recently. The results of this study can provide directional references for future research in the field.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the research lineage of rural landscape ecosystem services (RLESs) is of importance for improving rural landscapes and developing sustainable ecosystem services. However, there is currently no literature analysis on the scientific quantification and visualization of RLESs. In this study, 4524 articles related to RLESs from 1990 to 2021 were analyzed using the bibliometric method and ISI Web of Science database. The results show that RLES research hotspots have gradually shifted from the early keywords of \u201cvegetation\u201d, \u201cland use change\u201d, \u201cagriculture\u201d, \u201crural gradients\u201d and \u201cmodels\u201d to the emerging \u201ccultural ecosystem services\u201d, \u201crural tourism\u201d, \u201clandscape preferences\u201d and \u201cpolicy guidance\u201d. Scholars from developed and developing countries place different emphases on research hotspots in terms of research content, scale and methodology due to differences in their research backgrounds and other aspects. In addition, five categories of research fronts were obtained through literature co-citation analysis. Through burst word detection analysis, combined with basic research and research hotspots and frontier analysis, we concluded that future RLES research will focus on four areas: (1) the relationship and collaboration between and management of biodiversity and ecosystem services; (2) the landscape value of RLESs; (3) land-use changes and ecosystem service values; and (4) research methods for innovative RLESs. Our findings may contribute to better in-depth RLES research by providing a theoretical reference and practical help for future related research.",

    "abstract": "Due to improved data collection and processing techniques, forestry surveys are now more efficient and accurate, generating large amounts of forestry data. Forestry Big Data (FBD) has become a critical component of the forestry inventory investigation system. In this study, publications on FBD were identified via the Web of Science database, and a comprehensive bibliometric analysis, network analysis, and analysis of major research streams were conducted to present an overview of the FBD field. The results show that FBD research only began nearly a decade ago but has undergone an upswing since 2016. The studies were mainly conducted by China and the US, and collaboration among authors is relatively fragmented. FBD research involved interdisciplinary integration. Among all the keywords, data acquisition (data mining and remote sensing) and data processing (machine learning and deep learning) received more attention, while FBD applications (forecasting, biodiversity, and climate change) have only recently received attention. Our research reveals that the FBD research is still in the infancy stage but has grown rapidly in recent years. Data acquisition and data processing are the main research fields, whereas FBD applications have gradually emerged and may become the next focus.",

    "abstract": "Objectives To explore and analyze research hotspots and frontiers in CRF in ovarian cancer patients to provide an evidence-based basis for scholars and policymakers. Background Ovarian cancer is one of the most common and lethal gynecological malignancies. Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is an annoying and pervasive side-effect that seriously affects the activities of daily living and decreases the quality of life (QoL) of cancer survivors. Methods The literature was retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection (WOSCC) from inception to 2021-12-31. CiteSpace was used to discuss research countries, institutions, authors, and keywords. Results This study ultimately included 755 valid publications, and the number of publications showed a gradual upward trend. The countries, institutions, authors, and journals that have published the most articles and cited the most frequently were the United States, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Michael Friedlander and Amit M Oza, Gynecologic Oncology, and Journal of Clinical Oncology. The top three high-frequency keywords were Ovarian cancer, chemotherapy, and clinical trial. The top three keywords with the strongest citation bursts were cyclophosphamide, double-blind, and open-label. Conclusions Conducting multi-center, large-sample, randomized controlled clinical trials to determine whether chemotherapeutic agents have severe adverse effects and to discuss the relationship between CRF and QoL and overall survival in cancer survivors are hotspots in this field. The new trends may be applying double-blind, randomized controlled trials to clarify the causes of CRF and open-label, randomized trials to determine the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of chemotherapeutic agents.",

This study aimed to use the VOSviewer tool to access the research cores and frontiers on the relationship between lncRNAs and CRC. Our findings showed that the mechanism of lncRNA in the occurrence and development of CRC was the core theme of the field. (1) Immunotherapy and immune microenvironment of CRC and lncRNAs, (2) CRC and lncRNAs in exosomes and (3) CRC and lncRNA-targeted therapy might represent three research frontiers. A comprehensive understanding of their existing mechanisms and the search for new regulatory paradigms are the core topics of future research. This knowledge will also help us select appropriate targeting methods and select appropriate preclinical models to promote clinical translation and ultimately achieve precise treatment of CRC.",

    "abstract": "Research on COVID-19 has drawn the attention of scholars around the world since the outbreak of the pandemic. Several literature reviews of research topics and themes based on scientometric indicators or bibliometric analyses have already been conducted. However, topics and themes in linguistic-specific research on COVID-19 remain under-studied. With the help of the CiteSpace software, the present study reviewed linguistic research published in SSCI and A&HCI journals to address the identified gap in the literature. The overall performance of the documents was described and document co-citations, keyword co-occurrence, and keyword clusters were visualized via CiteSpace. The main topic areas identified in the reviewed studies ranged from the influences of COVID-19 on language education, and speech-language pathology to crisis communication. The results of the study indicate not only that COVID-19-related linguistic research is topically limited but also that insufficient attention has been accorded by linguistic researchers to Conceptual Metaphor Theory, Critical Discourse Analysis, Pragmatics, and Corpus-based discourse analysis in exploring pandemic discourses and texts.",

    "abstract": "A total of 2932 publications in the field of ozone pollution were obtained from the Web of Science and briefly reviewed using a bibliometric analysis and WOS-based citation reports. CiteSpace 5.7.R3 (64 bit) was used to perform a visualization of knowledge mapping by keywords co-words, burst analysis, co-cited reference analysis, and cooperation network analysis. Research topics in this field have mainly focused on three aspects: risk assessment of ozone pollution for both humans and plants under short-term and long-term exposure; ozone pollution characterization and modeling of ozone transport on different scales; and elucidating the mechanism of ozone formation and source apportionment. By clustering the co-cited references using the data from 2016 to 2021, the frontiers are found to be: (1) VOCs\u2019 precursors and ozone transformation mechanism; (2) modeling of source apportionment and source-oriented chemical transport considering meteorological influence to predict ozone concentration at different spatial and temporal scales; and (3) premature mortality and health burden with relation to ozone exposure. It should be mentioned that an emerging research hotspot is the utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) tools (e.g., machine learning, deep learning, etc.) to facilitate the modeling of big data at different scales.",

    "abstract": "Background: Since Lambotte and Payr first studied Mg-based alloys for orthopedics in 1900, the research of this field has finally ushered in vigorous development in the 21st century. From the perspective of quantitative analysis, this paper clearly demonstrated the global research trend from 2005 to 2021 by using bibliometrics and scientometric analysis. Methods: We obtained the publications from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database. The bibliometric and scientometric analysis was conducted by using R software, CiteSpace software, VOSviewer software, Pajek software and Microsoft Excel program. Results: In total, 1921 publications were retrieved. It can be found that the number of publications is gradually increasing year by year. We can find that the most prolific countrie, institution and researcher are China, Chinese Academy of Sciences and Zheng Yufeng, respectively. The most influential journals in this field are Acta Biomaterialia and Biomaterials, with 16,511 and 12,314 total citations, respectively. By conducting the co-cited documents-based clustering analysis, 16 research hotspots and their representative studies have been identified. Besides, by conducting analysis of keywords, we divided the keyword citation bursts representing the development of the field into three stages. Conclusion: The number of researches on the biodegradable Mg-based alloys increased sharply all over the world in the 21st century. China has made significant progress in biodegradable Mg-based alloy research. More focus will be placed on osteogenic differentiation, fabrication, graphene oxide, antibacterial property, bioactive glass and nanocomposite, which may be the next popular topics in the field.",

    "abstract": "Over the past 15 years, interest in additive manufacturing (AM) on lattice structures has significantly increased in producing 3D/4D objects. The purpose of this study is to gain a thorough grasp of the research pattern and the condition of the field\u2019s research today as well as identify obstacles towards future research. To accomplish the purpose, this work undertakes a scientometric analysis of the international research conducted on additive manufacturing for lattice structure materials published from 2002 to 2022. A total of 1290 journal articles from the Web of Science (WoS) database and 1766 journal articles from the Scopus database were found using a search system. This paper applied scientometric science, which is based on bibliometric analysis. The data were subjected to a scientometric study, which looked at the number of publications, authorship, regions by countries, keyword co-occurrence, literature coupling, and scientometric mapping. VOSviewer was used to establish research patterns, visualize maps, and identify transcendental issues. Thus, the quantitative determination of the primary research framework, papers, and themes of this research field was possible. In order to shed light on current developments in additive manufacturing for lattice structures, an extensive systematic study is provided. The scientometric analysis revealed a strong bias towards researching AM on lattice structures but little concentration on technologies that emerge from it. It also outlined its unmet research needs, which can benefit both the industry and academia. This review makes a prediction for the future, with contributions by educating researchers, manufacturers, and other experts on the current state of AM for lattice structures.",

    "abstract": "Scientometric reviews, facilitated by computational and visual analytical approaches, allow researchers to gain a thorough understanding of research trends and areas of concentration from a large number of publications. With the fast development of satellite altimetry, which has been effectively applied to a wide range of research topics, it is timely to summarize the scientific achievements of the previous 50 years and identify future trends in this field. A comprehensive overview of satellite altimetry was presented using a total of 8541 publications from the Web of Science Core Collection covering the years from 1970 to 2021. We begin by presenting the fundamental statistical results of the publications, such as the annual number of papers, study categories, countries/regions, afflictions, journals, authors, and keywords, in order to provide a comprehensive picture of satellite altimetry research. We discuss the co-occurrence of the authors in order to reveal the global collaboration network of satellite altimetry research. Finally, we utilised co-citation networks to detect the development trend and associated crucial publications for various specific topics. The findings show that satellite altimetry research has been changed immensely during the last half-century. The United States, France, China, England, and Germany made the most significant contributions in the field of satellite altimetry. The analysis reveals a clear link between technology advancements and the trend in satellite altimetry research. As a result, wide swath altimetry, GNSS-reflectometry, laser altimetry, terrestrial hydrology, and deep learning are among the most frontier study subjects. The findings of this work could guide a thorough understanding of satellite altimetry\u2019s overall development and research front.",

    "abstract": "A series of six science maps have been created visualising the shape of archaeological research between 2014 and 2021, using metadata from more than 50,000 academic documents. These maps present the intellectual base of the discipline as co-citation networks of sources and of authors, the language of archaeological research as both terms extracted from titles and abstracts and as author keywords, and, lastly, the networks of collaboration created by co-authorship between individuals and institutions. Comparison is made between 2014-2021 and an earlier study examining archaeological research between 2004 and 2013. Archaeology is revealed as a consistently broad and developing subject drawing extensively on methods and approaches from the sciences, social sciences, arts and humanities. It is intrinsically international in practice. Archaeological research is growing at a rate faster than the average for academic research. While there has been progress towards a more diverse community of researchers among those most highly cited, there remain significant issues in the observable diversity between different research areas within the same discipline and sometimes between similar research specialties. Classifications of archaeology by external bodies fail to grasp this diversity of archaeological research. Finally, diversity in terms variants suggests that there is a pressing need for the discipline to take control of its terminology.",

    "abstract": "The world is currently dealing with the aftermath of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which has resulted in momentous changes, the likes of which had not been witnessed within the previous century. These adverse events and the resulting uncertainty have posed enormous challenges to organizations, and many are on the verge of collapse. Organizations urgently need to enhance their risk management abilities and capacity to cope with crises, and organizational resilience, as such a tool, has attracted widespread attention in China and abroad. The purpose of this study is to understand the research status and development trend of organizational resilience. In this study, we applied CiteSpace to perform a visual analysis. Searching for topics related to organizational resilience, we retrieved papers published from 1990-2022 in the Web of Science Core database. Second, we constructed an author, institution, and country/region collaboration network to identify the most prolific authors, institutions and countries, respectively. The distribution of core journals determined by journal co-citations, the document co-citation network, and a clustering analysis revealed the research topics and knowledge structure, the author co-citation network revealed which authors were influential, the keyword co-citation network indicated popular research topics, and the keyword bursts highlighted the research fields. This paper analyzes the main contributions of organizational resilience research at the author, institution, and country levels; knowledge sources; interdisciplinary characteristics and research areas in organizational resilience; and direction of future research.",

    "title": "Extracting and Measuring Uncertain Biomedical Knowledge from Scientific Statements",
    "abstract": "Abstract Purpose Given the information overload of scientific literature, there is an increasing need for computable biomedical knowledge buried in free text. This study aimed to develop a novel approach to extracting and measuring uncertain biomedical knowledge from scientific statements. Design/methodology/approach Taking cardiovascular research publications in China as a sample, we extracted subject\u2013predicate\u2013object triples (SPO triples) as knowledge units and unknown/hedging/conflicting uncertainties as the knowledge context. We introduced information entropy (IE) as potential metric to quantify the uncertainty of epistemic status of scientific knowledge represented at subject-object pairs (SO pairs) levels. Findings The results indicated an extraordinary growth of cardiovascular publications in China while only a modest growth of the novel SPO triples. After evaluating the uncertainty of biomedical knowledge with IE, we identified the Top 10 SO pairs with highest IE, which implied the epistemic status pluralism. Visual presentation of the SO pairs overlaid with uncertainty provided a comprehensive overview of clusters of biomedical knowledge and contending topics in cardiovascular research. Research limitations The current methods didn\u2019t distinguish the specificity and probabilities of uncertainty cue words. The number of sentences surrounding a given triple may also influence the value of IE. Practical implications Our approach identified major uncertain knowledge areas such as diagnostic biomarkers, genetic polymorphism and co-existing risk factors related to cardiovascular diseases in China. These areas are suggested to be prioritized; new hypotheses need to be verified, while disputes, conflicts, and contradictions need to be settled. Originality/value We provided a novel approach by combining natural language processing and computational linguistics with informetric methods to extract and measure uncertain knowledge from scientific statements.",

    "abstract": "Research, understanding, and prediction of complex systems is an important starting point for human beings to tackle major problems and emergencies such as global warming and COVID-19. Research on innovation ecosystem is an important part of research on complex systems. With the rapid development of sophisticated industries, the rise of innovative countries, and the newly developed innovation theory, innovation ecosystem has become a new explanation and new paradigm for adapting to today\u2019s global innovation cooperation network and the scientific development of complex systems, which is also in line with China\u2019s concept of building an innovative country and promoting comprehensive innovation and international cooperation with scientific and technological innovation as the core. The Innovative Research Group at Peking University is the most representative scientific and technological innovation team in the frontier field of basic research in China. The characteristics of its organization mechanism and dynamic evolution connotation are consistent with the characteristics and evolution of innovation ecosystem. An excellent innovative research group is regarded as a small innovation ecosystem. We selected the \u201cEnvironmental Biogeochemistry\u201d Innovation Research Group at Peking University as a typical case in order to understand and analyze the evolution of cooperation among scientific and technological innovation teams, improve the healthy development as well as internal and external governance of this special small innovation ecosystem, promote the expansion of an innovation team cooperation network and the improvement of cooperation quality, promote the linkage supports of funding and management departments, and improve their scientific and technological governance abilities. Through scientometrics, visual analysis of knowledge maps, and an exploratory case study, we study the evolution process and development law of team cooperation. It is found that the main node authors of the cooperation network maintain strong cooperation frequency and centrality, and gradually strengthen with the expansion of the cooperation network and the evolution of time. Driven by the internal cooperative governance of the team and the external governance of the funding and management departments, this group has gradually formed a healthy, orderly, open, and cooperative special innovation ecosystem, which is conducive to the stability and sustainable development of the national innovation ecosystem and the global innovation ecosystem.",

    "abstract": "Achieving Net zero emissions is a common challenge facing all mankind. Low-carbon electricity has always been the main research field of global GHG emission control. The current article aims to use the bibliometric analysis to describe the characteristics and trends of low-carbon electricity publications from 1983 to 2021. We found that: (1) the number of publications in this area has shown an overall increase in the past 33 years. (2) the United States is the most powerful country in this field of research. Moreover, with the exception of major developed countries, more and more emerging economies have also joined the research on low-carbon power systems. (3) co-citation analysis and literature clustering characteristics show that the knowledge base in this field is focused on the decomposition of driving factors for carbon dioxide emissions and the optimization of the operation of renewable energy (RE) in low-carbon power systems. (4) the utilization of RE is a hot topic in low-carbon power research. Through this research, global scholars can be provided with the latest overview of valuable low-carbon energy research trends.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Purpose Methods to tackle Covid-19 have been developed by a wave of biomedical research but the pandemic has also influenced many aspects of society, generating a need for research into its consequences, and potentially changing the way existing topics are investigated. This article investigates the nature of this influence on the wider academic research mission. Design/methodology/approach This article reports an inductive content analysis of 500 randomly selected journal articles mentioning Covid-19, as recorded by the Dimensions scholarly database on 19 March 2021. Covid-19 mentions were coded for the influence of the disease on the research. Findings Whilst two thirds of these articles were about biomedicine (e.g. treatments, vaccines, virology), or health services in response to Covid-19, others covered the pandemic economy, society, safety, or education. In addition, some articles were not about the pandemic but stated that Covid-19 had increased or decreased the value of the reported research or changed the context in which it was conducted. Research limitations The findings relate only to Covid-19 influences declared in published journal articles. Practical implications Research managers and funders should consider whether their current procedures are effective in supporting researchers to address the evolving demands of pandemic societies, particularly in terms of timeliness. Originality/value The results show that although health research dominates the academic response to Covid-19, it is more widely disrupting academic research with new demands and challenges.",

    "abstract": "Family medicine physicians have been on the front lines of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic; however, research and publications in family medicine journals are rarely discussed. In this study, a bibliometric analysis was conducted on COVID-19-related articles published in PubMed-indexed English language family medicine journals in 2020, which recorded the publication date and author\u2019s country and collected citations from Google Scholar. Additionally, we used LitCovid (an open database of COVID-19 literature from PubMed) to determine the content categories of each article and total number of global publications. We found that 33 family medicine journals published 5107 articles in 2020, of which 409 (8.0%) were COVID-19-related articles. Among the article categories, 107 were original articles, accounting for only 26.2% of the articles. In terms of content, the main category was prevention, with 177 articles, accounting for 43.3% of the articles. At the beginning of the epidemic, 10 articles were published in family medicine journals in January 2020, accounting for 11% of all COVID-19-related articles worldwide; however, this accounted for <0.5% of all disciplinary studies in the entire year. Therefore, family medicine journals indeed play a sentinel role, and the intensities and timeliness of COVID-19 publications deserve further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Background: Emerging evidence implicates the dysregulated kynurenine pathway (KP), an immune-inflammatory pathway, in the pathophysiology of mood disorders (MD), including depression and bipolar disorder characterized by a low-grade chronic pro-inflammatory state. The metabolites of the KP, an important part of the microbiota-gut-brain axis, serve as immune system modulators linking the gut microbiota (GM) with the host central nervous system. Aim: This bibliometric analysis aimed to provide a first glimpse into the KP in MD, with a focus on GM research in this field, to guide future research and promote the development of this field. Methods: Publications relating to the KP in MD between the years 2000 and 2020 were retrieved from the Scopus and Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC), and analyzed in CiteSpace (5.7 R5W), biblioshiny (using R-Studio), and VOSviewer (1.6.16). Results: In total, 1,064 and 948 documents were extracted from the Scopus and WoSCC databases, respectively. The publications have shown rapid growth since 2006, partly owing to the largest research hotspot appearing since then, \u201cquinolinic acid.\u201d All the top five most relevant journals were in the neuropsychiatry field, such as Brain Behavior and Immunity. The United States and Innsbruck Medical University were the most influential country and institute, respectively. Journal co-citation analysis showed a strong tendency toward co-citation of research in the psychiatry field. Reference co-citation analysis revealed that the top four most important research focuses were \u201ckynurenine pathway,\u201d \u201cpsychoneuroimmunology,\u201d \u201cindoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase,\u201d and \u201cproinflammatory cytokines,\u201d and the most recent focus was \u201cgut-brain axis,\u201d thus indicating the role of the KP in bridging the GM and the host immune system, and together reflecting the field\u2019s research foundations. Overlap analysis between the thematic map of keywords and the keyword burst analysis revealed that the topics \u201cAlzheimer\u2019s disease,\u201d \u201cprefrontal cortex,\u201d and \u201cacid,\u201d were research frontiers. Conclusion: This comprehensive bibliometric study provides an updated perspective on research associated with the KP in MD, with a focus on the current status of GM research in this field. This perspective may benefit researchers in choosing suitable journals and collaborators, and aid in the further understanding of the field\u2019s hotspots and frontiers, thus facilitating future research.",

    "abstract": "Sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) has been attracting extensive attention from both practitioners and scholars. The main objective of this paper is to visualize and conduct a systematic scientometric review on 9151 articles and reviews published from 2007 to 2021. Research techniques of co-author analysis, co-word analysis, and co-citation analysis are applied to reveal the social structure, conceptual structure, and intellectual structure of the SSCM field, identify main concepts and research hotspots, and illuminate major specialties and emerging trends. The results of this work show that: (1) the top five most productive scholars are Joseph Sarkis, Kannan Govindan, Minglang Tseng, Angappa Gunasekaran, and Charbel Jose Chiappetta Jabbour. The top five most productive institutions are Hong Kong Polytech University, Islamic Azad University, University of Southern Denmark, Dalian University of Technology, and University of Tehran. (2) The main concepts include sustainable supply chain management, green supply chain management, circular economy, corporate social responsibility, and reverse logistics. The research hotspots of the SSCM field, currently, are game theory and circular economy related topics. (3) The leading researchers and influential journals are also identified. The emerging trends include sustainable supplier selection, circular economy, cap-and-trade regulation, blockchain technology, big data analytics, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the best-worst method and logistics performance. Finally, limitations and future researches are discussed. We expect this paper will show a big picture of the SSCM field for researchers as well as practitioners.",

    "abstract": "The breakthrough potentials of research papers can be explained by their boundary-spanning qualities. Here, for the first time, we apply the structural variation analysis (SVA) model and its affiliated metrics to investigate the extent to which such qualities characterize a group of Nobel Prize winning papers. We find that these papers share remarkable boundary-spanning traits, marked by exceptional abilities to connect disparate and topically-diverse clusters of research papers. Further, their publications exert structural variations on a scale that significantly alters the betweenness centrality distributions in existing intellectual space. Overall, SVA not only provides a set of leading indicators for describing future Nobel Prize winning papers, but also broadens our understanding of similar prize-winning properties that may have been overlooked among other regular publications.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 has had an unprecedented impact on education around the world. In order to understand and face this challenge, educators and researchers undertook a range of research, however the time that teachers have to undertake professional development and seek out such literature to inform their practice has been sorely lacking. Furthermore, literature exploring the wider variety of stakeholder experiences has been suggested to be missing. This living rapid systematic review synthesises K-12 research on teaching and learning during the COVID-19 pandemic, published in English and indexed in 5 international databases. 89 studies were included for synthesis in the present article, and the results are discussed against a bioecological model of student engagement. The results indicate that the majority of research was conducted in Europe and Asia, predominantly focused on teachers, with more studies undertaken in high schools. Online surveys were the most used method, although future research must include all study design information. Recommendations from the literature include providing further funding for professional development and equipment, prioritising equity, designing collaborative activities, and using a combination of synchronous and asynchronous technology. Gaps in the literature are highlighted and practical tips for teachers are provided.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nA concise visualization framework of related reports would increase readability and improve patient management. To this end, temporal referrals to prior comparative exams are an essential connection to previous exams in written reports. Due to unstructured narrative texts' variable structure and content, their extraction is hampered by poor computer readability. Natural language processing (NLP) permits the extraction of structured information from unstructured texts automatically and can serve as an essential input for such a novel visualization framework.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nThis study proposes and evaluates an NLP-based algorithm capable of extracting the temporal referrals in written radiology reports, applies it to all the radiology reports generated for 10 years, introduces a graphical representation of imaging reports, and investigates its benefits for clinical and research purposes.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn this single-center, university hospital, retrospective study, we developed a convolutional neural network capable of extracting the date of referrals from imaging reports. The model's performance was assessed by calculating precision, recall, and F1-score using an independent test set of 149 reports. Next, the algorithm was applied to our department's radiology reports generated from 2011 to 2021. Finally, the reports and their metadata were represented in a modulable graph.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFor extracting the date of referrals, the named-entity recognition (NER) model had a high precision of 0.93, a recall of 0.95, and an F1-score of 0.94. A total of 1,684,635 reports were included in the analysis. Temporal reference was mentioned in 53.3% (656,852/1,684,635), explicitly stated as not available in 21.0% (258,386/1,684,635), and omitted in 25.7% (317,059/1,684,635) of the reports. Imaging records can be visualized in a directed and modulable graph, in which the referring links represent the connecting arrows.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAutomatically extracting the date of referrals from unstructured radiology reports using deep learning NLP algorithms is feasible. Graphs refined the selection of distinct pathology pathways, facilitated the revelation of missing comparisons, and enabled the query of specific referring exam sequences. Further work is needed to evaluate its benefits in clinics, research, and resource planning.",

    "abstract": "Background Electronic medical records (EMRs) of patients with lung cancer (LC) capture a variety of health factors. Understanding the distribution of these factors will help identify key factors for risk prediction in preventive screening for LC. Objective We aimed to generate an integrated biomedical graph from EMR data and Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) ontology for LC, and to generate an LC health factor distribution from a hospital EMR of approximately 1 million patients. Methods The data were collected from 2 sets of 1397 patients with and those without LC. A patient-centered health factor graph was plotted with 108,000 standardized data, and a graph database was generated to integrate the graphs of patient health factors and the UMLS ontology. With the patient graph, we calculated the connection delta ratio (CDR) for each of the health factors to measure the relative strength of the factor\u2019s relationship to LC. Results The patient graph had 93,000 relations between the 2794 patient nodes and 650 factor nodes. An LC graph with 187 related biomedical concepts and 188 horizontal biomedical relations was plotted and linked to the patient graph. Searching the integrated biomedical graph with any number or category of health factors resulted in graphical representations of relationships between patients and factors, while searches using any patient presented the patient\u2019s health factors from the EMR and the LC knowledge graph (KG) from the UMLS in the same graph. Sorting the health factors by CDR in descending order generated a distribution of health factors for LC. The top 70 CDR-ranked factors of disease, symptom, medical history, observation, and laboratory test categories were verified to be concordant with those found in the literature. Conclusions By collecting standardized data of thousands of patients with and those without LC from the EMR, it was possible to generate a hospital-wide patient-centered health factor graph for graph search and presentation. The patient graph could be integrated with the UMLS KG for LC and thus enable hospitals to bring continuously updated international standard biomedical KGs from the UMLS for clinical use in hospitals. CDR analysis of the graph of patients with LC generated a CDR-sorted distribution of health factors, in which the top CDR-ranked health factors were concordant with the literature. The resulting distribution of LC health factors can be used to help personalize risk evaluation and preventive screening recommendations.",

    "abstract": "Representation Learning (RL) aims to convert data into low-dimensional and dense real-valued vectors, so as to realize reasoning in vector space. RL is one of the important research contents in the analysis of health data. This paper systematically reviews the latest research on Electronic Health Records (EHR) RL. We searched the Web of Science, Google Scholar, and Association for Computing Machinery Digital Library for papers involving EHR RL. On the basis of literature review, we propose a new taxonomy to categorize the state-of-the-art EHR RL methods into three categories: statistics learning-based RL methods, knowledge RL methods and graph RL methods. We analyze and summarize their characteristics according to the input data form and underlying learning mechanisms. In addition, we provide evaluation strategies to verify the quality of EHR representations from both intrinsic and extrinsic perspectives. Finally, we put forward three promising research directions to promote future research. Overall, this survey aims to provide a profound overview of state-of-the-art developments in the field of EHR RL and to help researchers find the most appropriate methods.",

    "abstract": "With the increasing availability of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and advances in deep learning techniques, developing deep predictive models that use EHR data to solve healthcare problems has gained momentum in recent years. The majority of clinical predictive models benefit from structured data in EHR (e.g., lab measurements and medications). Still, learning clinical outcomes from all possible information sources is one of the main challenges when building predictive models. This work focuses on two sources of information that have been underused by researchers; unstructured data (e.g., clinical notes) and a patient network. We propose a novel hybrid deep learning model, DeepNote-GNN, that integrates clinical notes information and patient network topological structure to improve 30-day hospital readmission prediction. DeepNote-GNN is a robust deep learning framework consisting of two modules: DeepNote and patient network. DeepNote extracts deep representations of clinical notes using a feature aggregation unit on top of a state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique - BERT. By exploiting these deep representations, a patient network is built, and Graph Neural Network (GNN) is used to train the network for hospital readmission predictions. Performance evaluation on the MIMIC-III dataset demonstrates that DeepNote-GNN achieves superior results compared to the state-of-the-art baselines on the 30-day hospital readmission task. We extensively analyze the DeepNote-GNN model to illustrate the effectiveness and contribution of each component of it. The model analysis shows that patient network has a significant contribution to the overall performance, and DeepNote-GNN is robust and can consistently perform well on the 30-day readmission prediction task.",

    "abstract": "Background Laboratory results are of central importance for clinical decision making. The time span between availability and review of results by clinicians is crucial to patient care. Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) are computational tools that can identify critical values automatically and help decrease treatment delay. Objective With this work, we aimed to implement and evaluate a CDSS that supports health care professionals and improves patient safety. In addition to our experiences, we also describe its main components in a general manner to make it applicable to a wide range of medical institutions and to empower colleagues to implement a similar system in their facilities. Methods Technical requirements must be taken into account before implementing a CDSS that performs laboratory diagnostics (labCDSS). These can be planned within the functional components of a reactive software agent, a computational framework for such a CDSS. Results We present AMPEL (Analysis and Reporting System for the Improvement of Patient Safety through Real-Time Integration of Laboratory Findings), a labCDSS that notifies health care professionals if a life-threatening medical condition is detected. We developed and implemented AMPEL at a university hospital and regional hospitals in Germany (University of Leipzig Medical Center and the Muldental Clinics in Grimma and Wurzen). It currently runs 5 different algorithms in parallel: hypokalemia, hypercalcemia, hyponatremia, hyperlactatemia, and acute kidney injury. Conclusions AMPEL enables continuous surveillance of patients. The system is constantly being evaluated and extended and has the capacity for many more algorithms. We hope to encourage colleagues from other institutions to design and implement similar CDSS using the theory, specifications, and experiences described in this work.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In laboratory medicine, much effort has been put into analytical quality in the past decades, making this medical profession one of the most standardized with the lowest rates of error. However, even the best analytical quality cannot compensate for errors or low quality in the pre or postanalytical phase of the total testing process. Guidelines for data reporting focus solely on defined data elements, which have to be provided alongside the analytical test results. No guidelines on how to format laboratory reports exist. The habit of reporting as much diagnostic data as possible, including supplemental information, may lead to an information overload. Considering the multiple tasks physicians have to do simultaneously, unfiltered data presentation may contribute to patient risk, as important information may be overlooked, or juxtaposition errors may occur. As laboratories should aim to answer clinical questions, rather than providing sole analytical results, optimizing formatting options may help improve the effectiveness and efficiency of medical decision-making. In this narrative review, we focus on the underappreciated topic of laboratory result reporting. We present published literature, focusing on the impact of laboratory result report formatting on medical decisions as well as approaches, potential benefits, and limitations for alternative report formats. We discuss influencing variables such as, for example, the type of patient (e.g. acute versus chronic), the medical specialty of the recipient of the report, the display of reference intervals, the medium or platform on which the laboratory report is presented (printed paper, within electronic health record systems, on handheld devices, etc.), the context in which the report is viewed in, and difficulties in formatting single versus cumulative reports. Evidence on this topic, especially experimental studies, is scarce. When considering the medical impact, it is of utmost importance that laboratories focus not only on the analytical aspects but on the total testing process. The achievement of high analytical quality may be of minor value if essential results get lost in overload or scattering of information by using a non-formatted tabular design. More experimental studies to define guidelines and to standardize effective and efficient reporting are most definitely needed.",

    "abstract": "Recent work on predicting patient outcomes in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) has focused heavily on the physiological time series data, largely ignoring sparse data such as diagnoses and medications. When they are included, they are usually concatenated in the late stages of a model, which may struggle to learn from rarer disease patterns. Instead, we propose a strategy to exploit diagnoses as relational information by connecting similar patients in a graph. To this end, we propose LSTM-GNN for patient outcome prediction tasks: a hybrid model combining Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs) for extracting temporal features and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for extracting the patient neighbourhood information. We demonstrate that LSTM-GNNs outperform the LSTM-only baseline on length of stay prediction tasks on the eICU database. More generally, our results indicate that exploiting information from neighbouring patient cases using graph neural networks is a promising research direction, yielding tangible returns in supervised learning performance on Electronic Health Records. \u2217 Equal first authorship.

    "abstract": "\n BACKGROUND\n Laboratory results are of central importance for clinical decision making. The time span between availability and review of results by clinicians is crucial to patient care. Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) are computational tools that can identify critical values automatically and help decrease treatment delay.\n \n \n OBJECTIVE\n With this work, we aimed to implement and evaluate a CDSS that supports health care professionals and improves patient safety. In addition to our experiences, we also describe its main components in a general manner to make it applicable to a wide range of medical institutions and to empower colleagues to implement a similar system in their facilities.\n \n \n METHODS\n Technical requirements must be taken into account before implementing a CDSS that performs laboratory diagnostics (labCDSS). These can be planned within the functional components of a reactive software agent, a computational framework for such a CDSS.\n \n \n RESULTS\n We present AMPEL (Analysis and Reporting System for the Improvement of Patient Safety through Real-Time Integration of Laboratory Findings), a labCDSS that notifies health care professionals if a life-threatening medical condition is detected. We developed and implemented AMPEL at a university hospital and regional hospitals in Germany (University of Leipzig Medical Center and the Muldental Clinics in Grimma and Wurzen). It currently runs 5 different algorithms in parallel: hypokalemia, hypercalcemia, hyponatremia, hyperlactatemia, and acute kidney injury.\n \n \n CONCLUSIONS\n AMPEL enables continuous surveillance of patients. The system is constantly being evaluated and extended and has the capacity for many more algorithms. We hope to encourage colleagues from other institutions to design and implement similar CDSS using the theory, specifications, and experiences described in this work.\n",

    "abstract": "One in ten people are affected by rare diseases, and three out of ten children with rare diseases will not live past age five. However, the small market size of individual rare diseases, combined with the time and capital requirements of pharmaceutical R&D, have hindered the development of new drugs for these cases. A promising alternative is drug repurposing, whereby existing FDA-approved drugs might be used to treat diseases different from their original indications. In order to generate drug repurposing hypotheses in a systematic and comprehensive fashion, it is essential to integrate information from across the literature of pharmacology, genetics, and pathology. To this end, we leverage a newly developed knowledge graph, the Global Network of Biomedical Relationships (GNBR). GNBR is a large, heterogeneous knowledge graph comprising drug, disease, and gene (or protein) entities linked by a small set of semantic themes derived from the abstracts of biomedical literature. We apply a knowledge graph embedding method that explicitly models the uncertainty associated with literature-derived relationships and uses link prediction to generate drug repurposing hypotheses. This approach achieves high performance on a gold-standard test set of known drug indications (AUROC = 0.89) and is capable of generating novel repurposing hypotheses, which we independently validate using external literature sources and protein interaction networks. Finally, we demonstrate the ability of our model to produce explanations of its predictions.",

    "abstract": "Most phenomena related to biomedical tasks are inherently complex, and in many cases, are expressed as signals on biomedical Knowledge Graphs (KGs). In this work, we introduce the use of a new representation framework, the Prime Adjacency Matrix (PAM) for biomedical KGs, which allows for very efficient network analysis. PAM utilizes prime numbers to enable representing the whole KG with a single adjacency matrix and the fast computation of multiple properties of the network. We illustrate the applicability of the framework in the biomedical domain by working on different biomedical knowledge graphs and by providing two case studies: one on drug-repurposing for COVID-19 and one on important metapath extraction. We show that we achieve better results than the original proposed workflows, using very simple methods that require no training, in considerably less time.",

Features include a simple, modular extract-transform-load (ETL) pattern for producing graphs compliant with Biolink Model (a high-level data model for standardizing biological data), easy integration of any OBO (Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies) ontology, cached downloads of upstream data sources, versioned and automatically updated builds with stable URLs, web-browsable storage of KG artifacts on cloud infrastructure, and easy reuse of transformed subgraphs across projects. Current KG-Hub projects span use cases including COVID-19 research, drug repurposing, microbial-environmental interactions, and rare disease research. KG-Hub is equipped with tooling to easily analyze and manipulate knowledge graphs. KG-Hub is also tightly integrated with graph machine learning (ML) tools which allow automated graph machine learning, including node embeddings and training of models for link prediction and node classification.",

    "title": "KGML-xDTD: A Knowledge Graph-based Machine Learning Framework for Drug Treatment Prediction and Mechanism Description",
    "abstract": "Background Computational drug repurposing is a cost- and time-efficient approach that aims to identify new therapeutic targets or diseases (indications) of existing drugs/compounds. It is especially critical for emerging and/or orphan diseases due to its cheaper investment and shorter research cycle compared with traditional wet-lab drug discovery approaches. However, the underlying mechanisms of action (MOAs) between repurposed drugs and their target diseases remain largely unknown, which is still a main obstacle for computational drug repurposing methods to be widely adopted in clinical settings. Results In this work, we propose KGML-xDTD : a Knowledge Graph-based Machine Learning framework for explainably predicting Drugs Treating Diseases. It is a two-module framework that not only predicts the treatment probabilities between drugs/compounds and diseases but also biologically explains them via knowledge graph (KG) path-based, testable mechanisms of action (MOAs). We leverage knowledge-and-publication based information to extract biologically meaningful \u201cdemonstration paths\u201d as the intermediate guidance in the Graph-based Reinforcement Learning (GRL) path-finding process. Comprehensive experiments and case study analyses show that the proposed framework can achieve state-of-the-art performance in both predictions of drug repurposing and recapitulation of human-curated drug MOA paths. Conclusions KGML-xDTD is the first model framework that can offer KG-path explanations for drug repurposing predictions by leveraging the combination of prediction outcomes and existing biological knowledge and publications. We believe it can effectively reduce \u201cblack-box\u201d concerns and increase prediction confidence for drug repurposing based on predicted path-based explanations, and further accelerate the process of drug discovery for emerging diseases.",

    "title": "Extending the Nested Model for User-Centric XAI: A Design Study on GNN-based Drug Repurposing",
    "abstract": "Whether AI explanations can help users achieve specific tasks efficiently (i.e., usable explanations) is significantly influenced by their visual presentation. While many techniques exist to generate explanations, it remains unclear how to select and visually present AI explanations based on the characteristics of domain users. This paper aims to understand this question through a multidisciplinary design study for a specific problem: explaining graph neural network (GNN) predictions to domain experts in drug repurposing, i.e., reuse of existing drugs for new diseases. Building on the nested design model of visualization, we incorporate XAI design considerations from a literature review and from our collaborators' feedback into the design process. Specifically, we discuss XAI-related design considerations for usable visual explanations at each design layer: target user, usage context, domain explanation, and XAI goal at the domain layer; format, granularity, and operation of explanations at the abstraction layer; encodings and interactions at the visualization layer; and XAI and rendering algorithm at the algorithm layer. We present how the extended nested model motivates and informs the design of DrugExplorer, an XAI tool for drug repurposing. Based on our domain characterization, DrugExplorer provides path-based explanations and presents them both as individual paths and meta-paths for two key XAI operations, why and what else. DrugExplorer offers a novel visualization design called MetaMatrix with a set of interactions to help domain users organize and compare explanation paths at different levels of granularity to generate domain-meaningful insights. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the selected visual presentation and DrugExplorer as a whole via a usage scenario, a user study, and expert interviews. From these evaluations, we derive insightful observations and reflections that can inform the design of XAI visualizations for other scientific applications.",

In this work, we argue that NLP models can help domain experts distill and understand the literature in this complex, high-stakes area. Our task is to automatically identify contradictory claims about COVID-19 drug efficacy. We frame this as a natural language inference problem and offer a new NLI dataset created by domain experts. The NLI framing allows us to create curricula combining existing datasets and our own. The resulting models are useful investigative tools.

    "abstract": "Birth defects are functional and structural abnormalities that impact 1 in 33 births in the United States. Birth defects have been attributed to genetic as well as other factors, but for most birth defects there are no known causes. Small molecule drugs, cosmetics, foods, and environmental pollutants may cause birth defects when the mother is exposed to them during pregnancy. These molecules may interfere with the process of normal fetal development. To characterize associations between small molecule compounds and their potential to induce specific birth abnormalities, we gathered knowledge from multiple sources to construct a reproductive toxicity Knowledge Graph (ReproTox-KG) with an initial focus on associations between birth defects, drugs, and genes. Specifically, to construct ReproTox-KG we gathered data from drug/birth-defect associations from co-mentions in published abstracts, gene/birth-defect associations from genetic studies, drug- and preclinical-compound-induced gene expression data, known drug targets, genetic burden scores for all human genes, and placental crossing scores for all small molecules in ReproTox-KG. Using the data stored within ReproTox-KG, we scored 30,000 preclinical small molecules for their potential to induce birth defects. Querying the ReproTox-KG, we identified over 500 birth-defect/gene/drug cliques that can be used to explain molecular mechanisms for drug-induced birth defects. The ReproTox-KG is provided as curated tables and via a web-based user interface that can enable users to explore the associations between birth defects, approved and preclinical drugs, and human genes.",

    "title": "REDIRECTION: Generating drug repurposing hypotheses using link prediction with DISNET data",
    "abstract": "In the recent years and due to COVID-19 pandemic, drug repurposing or repositioning has been placed in the spotlight. Giving new therapeutic uses to already existing drugs, this discipline allows to streamline the drug discovery process, reducing the costs and risks inherent to de novo development. Computational approaches have gained momentum, and emerging techniques from the machine learning domain have proved themselves as highly exploitable means for repurposing prediction. Against this backdrop, one can find that biomedical data can be represented in terms of graphs, which allow depicting in a very expressive manner the underlying structure of the information. Combining these graph data structures with deep learning models enhances the prediction of new links, such as potential disease-drug connections. In this paper, we present a new model named REDIRECTION, which aim is to predict new disease-drug links in the context of drug repurposing. It has been trained with a part of the DISNET biomedical graph, formed by diseases, symptoms, drugs, and their relationships. The reserved testing graph for the evaluation has yielded to an AUROC of 0.93 and an AUPRC of 0.90. We have performed a secondary validation of REDIRECTION using RepoDB data as the testing set, which has led to an AUROC of 0.87 and a AUPRC of 0.83. In the light of these results, we believe that REDIRECTION can be a meaningful and promising tool to generate drug repurposing hypotheses.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The cost of drug development continues to rise and may be prohibitive in cases of unmet clinical need, particularly for rare diseases. Artificial intelligence-based methods are promising in their potential to discover new treatment options. The task of drug repurposing hypothesis generation is well-posed as a link prediction problem in a knowledge graph (KG) of interacting of drugs, proteins, genes and disease phenotypes. KGs derived from biomedical literature are semantically rich and up-to-date representations of scientific knowledge. Inference methods on scientific KGs can be confounded by unspecified contexts and contradictions. Extracting context enables incorporation of relevant pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic detail, such as tissue specificity of interactions. Contradictions in biomedical KGs may arise when contexts are omitted or due to contradicting research claims. In this review, we describe challenges to creating literature-scale representations of pharmacological knowledge and survey current approaches toward incorporating context and resolving contradictions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective To summarize applications of natural language processing (NLP) in model informed drug development (MIDD) and identify potential areas of improvement. Materials and Methods Publications found on PubMed and Google Scholar, websites and GitHub repositories for NLP libraries and models. Publications describing applications of NLP in MIDD were reviewed. The applications were stratified into 3 stages: drug discovery, clinical trials, and pharmacovigilance. Key NLP functionalities used for these applications were assessed. Programming libraries and open-source resources for the implementation of NLP functionalities in MIDD were identified. Results NLP has been utilized to aid various processes in drug development lifecycle such as gene-disease mapping, biomarker discovery, patient-trial matching, adverse drug events detection, etc. These applications commonly use NLP functionalities of named entity recognition, word embeddings, entity resolution, assertion status detection, relation extraction, and topic modeling. The current state-of-the-art for implementing these functionalities in MIDD applications are transformer models that utilize transfer learning for enhanced performance. Various libraries in python, R, and Java like huggingface, sparkNLP, and KoRpus as well as open-source platforms such as DisGeNet, DeepEnroll, and Transmol have enabled convenient implementation of NLP models to MIDD applications. Discussion Challenges such as reproducibility, explainability, fairness, limited data, limited language-support, and security need to be overcome to ensure wider adoption of NLP in MIDD landscape. There are opportunities to improve the performance of existing models and expand the use of NLP in newer areas of MIDD. Conclusions This review provides an overview of the potential and pitfalls of current NLP approaches in MIDD.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances have witnessed a growth of herbalism studies adopting a modern scientific approach in molecular medicine, offering valuable domain knowledge that can potentially boost the development of herbalism with evidence-supported efficacy and safety. However, these domain-specific scientific findings have not been systematically organized, affecting the efficiency of knowledge discovery and usage. Existing knowledge graphs in herbalism mainly focus on diagnosis and treatment with an absence of knowledge connection with molecular medicine. To fill this gap, we present HerbKG, a knowledge graph that bridges herbal and molecular medicine. The core bio-entities of HerbKG include herbs, chemicals extracted from the herbs, genes that are affected by the chemicals, and diseases treated by herbs due to the functions of genes. We have developed a learning framework to automate the process of HerbKG construction. The resulting HerbKG, after analyzing over 500K PubMed abstracts, is populated with 53K relations, providing extensive herbal-molecular domain knowledge in support of downstream applications. The code and an interactive tool are available at https://github.com/FeiYee/HerbKG.",

    "abstract": "Indication expansion aims to find new indications for existing targets in order to accelerate the process of launching a new drug for a disease on the market. The rapid increase in data types and data sources for computational drug discovery has fostered the use of semantic knowledge graphs (KGs) for indication expansion through target centric approaches, or in other words, target repositioning. Previously, we developed a novel method to construct a KG for indication expansion studies, with the aim of finding and justifying alternative indications for a target gene of interest. In contrast to other KGs, ours combines human-curated full-text literature and gene expression data from biomedical databases to encode relationships between genes, diseases, and tissues. Here, we assessed the suitability of our KG for explainable target-disease link prediction using a glass-box approach. To evaluate the predictive power of our KG, we applied shortest path with tissue information- and embedding-based prediction methods to a graph constructed with information published before or during 2010. We also obtained random baselines by applying the shortest path predictive methods to KGs with randomly shuffled node labels. Then, we evaluated the accuracy of the top predictions using gene-disease links reported after 2010. In addition, we investigated the contribution of the KG\u2019s tissue expression entity to the prediction performance. Our experiments showed that shortest path-based methods significantly outperform the random baselines and embedding-based methods outperform the shortest path predictions. Importantly, removing the tissue expression entity from the KG severely impacts the quality of the predictions, especially those produced by the embedding approaches. Finally, since the interpretability of the predictions is crucial in indication expansion, we highlight the advantages of our glass-box model through the examination of example candidate target-disease predictions.",

    "abstract": "Over the last decade, for the first time, substantial efforts have been directed at the development of dedicated in silico platforms for drug repurposing, including initiatives targeting cancers and conditions as diverse as cryptosporidiosis, dengue, dental caries, diabetes, herpes, lupus, malaria, tuberculosis and Covid-19 related respiratory disease. This review outlines some of the exciting advances in the specific applications of in silico approaches to the challenge of drug repurposing and focuses particularly on where these efforts have resulted in the development of generic platform technologies of broad value to researchers involved in programmatic drug repurposing work. Recent advances in molecular docking methodologies and validation approaches, and their combination with machine learning or deep learning approaches are continually enhancing the precision of repurposing efforts. The meaningful integration of better understanding of molecular mechanisms with molecular pathway data and knowledge of disease networks is widening the scope for discovery of repurposing opportunities. The power of Artificial Intelligence is being gainfully exploited to advance progress in an integrated science that extends from the sub-atomic to the whole system level. There are many promising emerging developments but there are remaining challenges to be overcome in the successful integration of the new advances in useful platforms. In conclusion, the essential component requirements for development of powerful and well optimised drug repurposing screening platforms are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Motivation Understanding chemical\u2013gene interactions (CGIs) is crucial for screening drugs. Wet experiments are usually costly and laborious, which limits relevant studies to a small scale. On the contrary, computational studies enable efficient in-silico exploration. For the CGI prediction problem, a common method is to perform systematic analyses on a heterogeneous network involving various biomedical entities. Recently, graph neural networks become popular in the field of relation prediction. However, the inherent heterogeneous complexity of biological interaction networks and the massive amount of data pose enormous challenges. This paper aims to develop a data-driven model that is capable of learning latent information from the interaction network and making correct predictions. Results We developed BioNet, a deep biological networkmodel with a graph encoder\u2013decoder architecture. The graph encoder utilizes graph convolution to learn latent information embedded in complex interactions among chemicals, genes, diseases and biological pathways. The learning process is featured by two consecutive steps. Then, embedded information learnt by the encoder is then employed to make multi-type interaction predictions between chemicals and genes with a tensor decomposition decoder based on the RESCAL algorithm. BioNet includes 79 325 entities as nodes, and 34 005 501 relations as edges. To train such a massive deep graph model, BioNet introduces a parallel training algorithm utilizing multiple Graphics Processing Unit (GPUs). The evaluation experiments indicated that BioNet exhibits outstanding prediction performance with a best area under Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.952, which significantly surpasses state-of-theart methods. For further validation, top predicted CGIs of cancer and COVID-19 by BioNet were verified by external curated data and published literature.",

    "abstract": "Background Drug repurposing aims at finding new targets for already developed drugs. It becomes more relevant as the cost of discovering new drugs steadily increases. To find new potential targets for a drug, an abundance of methods and existing biomedical knowledge from different domains can be leveraged. Recently, knowledge graphs have emerged in the biomedical domain that integrate information about genes, drugs, diseases and other biological domains. Knowledge graphs can be used to predict new connections between compounds and diseases, leveraging the interconnected biomedical data around them. While real world use cases such as drug repurposing are only interested in one specific relation type, widely used knowledge graph embedding models simultaneously optimize over all relation types in the graph. This can lead the models to underfit the data that is most relevant for the desired relation type. For example, if we want to learn embeddings to predict links between compounds and diseases but almost the entirety of relations in the graph is incident to other pairs of entity types, then the resulting embeddings are likely not optimised to predict links between compounds and diseases. We propose a method that leverages domain knowledge in the form of metapaths and use them to filter two biomedical knowledge graphs (Hetionet and DRKG) for the purpose of improving performance on the prediction task of drug repurposing while simultaneously increasing computational efficiency. Results We find that our method reduces the number of entities by 60% on Hetionet and 26% on DRKG, while leading to an improvement in prediction performance of up to 40.8% on Hetionet and 14.2% on DRKG, with an average improvement of 20.6% on Hetionet and 8.9% on DRKG. Additionally, prioritization of antiviral compounds for SARS CoV-2 improves after task-driven filtering is applied. Conclusion Knowledge graphs contain facts that are counter productive for specific tasks, in our case drug repurposing. We also demonstrate that these facts can be removed, resulting in an improved performance in that task and a more efficient learning process.",

    "title": "Predicting Drug Repurposing Candidates and Their Mechanisms from A Biomedical Knowledge Graph",
    "abstract": "Computational drug repurposing is a cost- and time-ef\ufb01cient method to identify new indications of approved or experimental drugs/compounds. It is especially critical for emerging and/or orphan diseases due to its cheaper investment and shorter research cycle compared with traditional wet-lab drug discovery approaches. However, the underlying mechanisms of action between repurposed drugs and their target diseases remain largely unknown, which is still an unsolved issue in existing repurposing methods. As such, computational drug repurposing has not been widely adopted in clinical settings. In this work, based on a massive biomedical knowledge graph, we propose a computational drug repurposing framework that not only predicts the treatment probabilities between drugs and diseases but also predicts the path-based, testable mechanisms of action (MOAs) as their biomedical explanations. Speci\ufb01cally, we utilize the GraphSAGE model in an unsupervised manner to integrate each entity\u2019s neighborhood information and employ a Random Forest model to predict the treatment probabilities between pairs of drugs and diseases. Moreover, we train an adversarial actor-critic reinforcement learning model to predict the potential MOA for explaining drug purposing. To encourage the model to \ufb01nd biologically reasonable paths, we utilize the curated molecular interactions of drugs and a PubMed-publication-based concept distance to extract potential drug MOA paths from the knowledge graph as \"demonstration paths\" to guide the model during the process of path-\ufb01nding. Comprehensive experiments and case studies show that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both predictive performance of drug repurposing and explanatory performance of recapitulating human-curated DrugMechDB-based paths.",

    "abstract": "Developing drugs for treating Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been extremely challenging and costly due to limited knowledge on underlying biological mechanisms and therapeutic targets. Repurposing drugs or their combination has shown potential in accelerating drug development due to the reduced drug toxicity while targeting multiple pathologies. To address the challenge in AD drug development, we developed a multi-task machine learning pipeline to integrate a comprehensive knowledge graph on biological/pharmacological interactions and multi-level evidence on drug efficacy, to identify repurposable drugs and their combination candidates. To assure our derived node embeddings reliably reflect complex interactions in our AD knowledge graph, we first designed a series of evaluation studies and found our node embeddings have excellent performance (AUROC=0.991, AUPRC=0.988) on storing this existing knowledge while simultaneously recognizing AD-related gene nodes (AUROC=0.947, AUPRC=0.583). To predict repurposable candidates, we utilized the multi-level evidence as ground-truth labels for the ranking task. We experimentally validated the top-ranked candidates in neuronal cells, identifying drug combinations with efficacy in reducing oxidative stress and safety in maintaining neuronal viability and morphology. This pipeline exhibited the ability to preserve complex biological interactions of Alzheimer's Disease into embeddings, which were then can be applied in multi-task learning for drug prioritization. Our study confirmed several biologically efficacious drug combinations, demonstrating a feasible synergistic drug repurposing pipeline for Alzheimer's Disease.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes an ongoing multi-scale visual analytics approach for exploring and analyzing biomedical knowledge at scale. We utilize global and local views, hierarchical and flow-based graph layouts, multi-faceted search, neighborhood recommendations, and document visualizations to help researchers interactively explore, query, and analyze biological graphs against the backdrop of biomedical knowledge. The generality of our approach - insofar as it requires only knowledge graphs linked to documents - means it can support a range of therapeutic use cases across different domains, from disease propagation to drug discovery. Early interactions with domain experts support our approach for use cases with graphs with over 40,000 nodes and 350,000 edges.",

Herein, we present a multidisciplinary academic-industrial review of the topic within the context of drug discovery and development. After introducing key terms and modelling approaches, we move chronologically through the drug development pipeline to identify and summarize work incorporating: target identification, design of small molecules and biologics, and drug repurposing. Whilst the field is still emerging, key milestones including repurposed drugs entering in vivo studies, suggest GML will become a modelling framework of choice within biomedical machine learning.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Introduction Knowledge graphs have proven to be promising systems of information storage and retrieval. Due to the recent explosion of heterogeneous multimodal data sources generated in the biomedical domain, and an industry shift toward a systems biology approach, knowledge graphs have emerged as attractive methods of data storage and hypothesis generation. Areas covered In this review, the author summarizes the applications of knowledge graphs in drug discovery. They evaluate their utility; differentiating between academic exercises in graph theory, and useful tools to derive novel insights, highlighting target identification and drug repurposing as two areas showing particular promise. They provide a case study on COVID-19, summarizing the research that used knowledge graphs to identify repurposable drug candidates. They describe the dangers of degree and literature bias, and discuss mitigation strategies. Expert opinion Whilst knowledge graphs and graph-based machine learning have certainly shown promise, they remain relatively immature technologies. Many popular link prediction algorithms fail to address strong biases in biomedical data, and only highlight biological associations, failing to model causal relationships in complex dynamic biological systems. These problems need to be addressed before knowledge graphs reach their true potential in drug discovery.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge bases often consist of facts which are harvested from a variety of sources, many of which are noisy and some of which conflict, resulting in a level of uncertainty for each triple. Knowledge bases are also often incomplete, prompting the use of embedding methods to generalize from known facts, however, existing embedding methods only model triple-level uncertainty, and reasoning results lack global consistency. To address these shortcomings, we propose BEUrRE, a novel uncertain knowledge graph embedding method with calibrated probabilistic semantics. BEUrRE models each entity as a box (i.e. axis-aligned hyperrectangle) and relations between two entities as affine transforms on the head and tail entity boxes. The geometry of the boxes allows for efficient calculation of intersections and volumes, endowing the model with calibrated probabilistic semantics and facilitating the incorporation of relational constraints. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that BEUrRE consistently outperforms baselines on confidence prediction and fact ranking due to its probabilistic calibration and ability to capture high-order dependencies among facts.",

    "title": "FORUM: building a Knowledge Graph from public databases and scientific literature to extract associations between chemicals and diseases",
    "abstract": "Metabolomics studies aim at reporting a metabolic signature (list of metabolites) related to a particular experimental condition. These signatures are instrumental in the identification of biomarkers or classification of individuals, however their biological and physiological interpretation remains a challenge. Overcoming this challenge is critical when aiming to associate metabolic signatures with potential pathological outcomes. To support this task, we introduce FORUM: a Knowledge Graph (KG) providing a semantic representation of relations between chemicals and biomedical concepts, built from a federation of life science databases and scientific literature repositories. An important number of scientific articles discuss relations between chemical compounds and biomedical concepts in various contexts, from biomarkers to therapeutic uses. The extraction of these statements and their interconnection in a graph structure can thus allow us to identify and explore relations strongly supported in the scientific literature. The use of a Semantic Web framework on biological data allows us to apply ontological based reasoning to infer new relations between entities. We show that these new relations provide different levels of abstraction and could open the path to new hypotheses. We estimate the statistical relevance of each extracted relation, explicit or inferred, using an enrichment analysis, and instantiate them as new knowledge in the KG to support results interpretation/further inquiries. Beyond this result, FORUM can also provide insights into complex biological questions and the extracted information could then be used for further developments. Containing more than 8 billion triples and providing more than 8 million relations, FORUM leverages the increasing availability of linked datasets in life science and is built in agreement with FAIR principles. A web interface to browse and download the extracted relations, as well as a SPARQL endpoint to directly probe the whole FORUM knowledge graph, are available at https://forum-webapp.semantic-metabolomics.fr. The code needed to reproduce the triplestore is available at https://github.com/eMetaboHUB/Forum-DiseasesChem.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The COVID-19 disease led to an unprecedented health emergency, still ongoing worldwide. Given the lack of a vaccine or a clear therapeutic strategy to counteract the infection as well as its secondary effects, there is currently a pressing need to generate new insights into the SARS-CoV-2 induced host response. Biomedical data can help to investigate new aspects of the COVID-19 pathogenesis, but source heterogeneity represents a major drawback and limitation. In this work, we applied data integration methods to develop a Unified Knowledge Space (UKS) and used it to identify a new set of genes associated with SARS-CoV-2 host response, both in vitro and in vivo. Functional analysis of these genes reveals possible long-term systemic effects of the infection, such as vascular remodelling and fibrosis. Finally, we identified a set of potentially relevant drugs targeting proteins involved in multiple steps of the host response to the virus.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Drug repositioning has received increased attention since the past decade as several blockbuster drugs have come out of repositioning. Computational approaches are significantly contributing to these efforts, of which, network-based methods play a key role. Various structural (topological) network measures have thereby contributed to uncovering unintuitive functional relationships and repositioning candidates in drug-disease and other networks. This review gives a broad overview of the topic, and offers perspectives on the application of topological measures for network analysis. It also discusses unexplored measures, and draws attention to a wider scope of application efforts, especially in drug repositioning.",

    "abstract": "Drug repositioning, modeled as a link prediction problem over medical knowledge graphs (KGs), has great potential in \ufb01nding new usage or targets for approved medicine with relatively low cost. However, the semantic information in medical KGs is rarely utilized, let alone the external medical databases curated by domain experts. This work attempts to integrate textual descriptions of biomedical KG entities in training knowledge graph embeddings (KGEs) and evaluates their effec-tiveness for drug repositioning. We implement multiple text augmentation methods on TransE as a case study and further apply the best method on other embedding models. Both qualitative and quantitative error analyses with two novel metrics are conducted to shed light on the effects of adding textual information in our model. We conclude that textual information is generally useful, but it may also back\ufb01re.",

    "abstract": "Biomedical knowledge graphs (KGs), which can help with the understanding of complex biological systems and pathologies, have begun to play a critical role in medical practice and research. However, challenges remain in their embedding and use due to their complex nature and the specific demands of their construction. Existing studies often suffer from problems such as sparse and noisy datasets, insufficient modeling methods and non-uniform evaluation metrics. In this work, we established a comprehensive KG system for the biomedical field in an attempt to bridge the gap. Here, we introduced PharmKG, a multi-relational, attributed biomedical KG, composed of more than 500\u00a0000 individual interconnections between genes, drugs and diseases, with 29 relation types over a vocabulary of ~8000 disambiguated entities. Each entity in PharmKG is attached with heterogeneous, domain-specific information obtained from multi-omics data, i.e. gene expression, chemical structure and disease word embedding, while preserving the semantic and biomedical features. For baselines, we offered nine state-of-the-art KG embedding (KGE) approaches and a new biological, intuitive, graph neural network-based KGE method that uses a combination of both global network structure and heterogeneous domain features. Based on the proposed benchmark, we conducted extensive experiments to assess these KGE models using multiple evaluation metrics. Finally, we discussed our observations across various downstream biological tasks and provide insights and guidelines for how to use a KG in biomedicine. We hope that the unprecedented quality and diversity of PharmKG will lead to advances in biomedical KG construction, embedding and application.",

    "title": "A Methodology to Develop Knowledge Graphs for Indication Expansion: An Exploratory Study",
    "abstract": "The rapid increase in data sources for computational drug discovery have resulted in the subject of ontology research becoming a key point for not only data integration, but they also have enriched the semantics of biological networks. Drug repurposing using populated ontologies, in other words semantic knowledge graphs, have received much attention in the past years. Firstly, researchers constructed knowledge graphs from biological data sources to predict disease-drug relations. After considering the reliability of the data, these studies are followed by the construction of knowledge graphs from published unstructured data via text mining tools. Only two recent examples are available utilizing PubMed abstracts to build knowledge graphs for drug discovery. However, these studies highlight their limitations due to dependency to the text mining tools and missing information in the abstracts. In light of this previous work, we conducted an exploratory study to develop a novel method for constructing knowledge graphs for indication expansion studies in which the aim is to find an alternative indication for the main target. The implication of the study is that the knowledge graph consists of both biological data sources which have publication references and human curated text mining results from the full texts. Consequently, the prediction results of the methodology includes one or more publication references. This paper presents the methodology together with the application on two selected cases. Moreover, we share the results, lessons learned and future work.",

    "abstract": "Graph Machine Learning (GML) is receiving growing interest within the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries for its ability to model biomolecular structures, the functional relationships between them, and integrate multi-omic datasets - amongst other data types. Herein, we present a multidisciplinary academic-industrial review of the topic within the context of drug discovery and development. After introducing key terms and modelling approaches, we move chronologically through the drug development pipeline to identify and summarise work incorporating: target identification, design of small molecules and biologics, and drug repurposing. Whilst the field is still emerging, key milestones including repurposed drugs entering in vivo studies, suggest graph machine learning will become a modelling framework of choice within biomedical machine learning.",

    "title": "Phenotypically Similar Rare Disease Identification from an Integrative Knowledge Graph for Data Harmonization: Preliminary Study",
    "abstract": "Background Although many efforts have been made to develop comprehensive disease resources that capture rare disease information for the purpose of clinical decision making and education, there is no standardized protocol for defining and harmonizing rare diseases across multiple resources. This introduces data redundancy and inconsistency that may ultimately increase confusion and difficulty for the wide use of these resources. To overcome such encumbrances, we report our preliminary study to identify phenotypical similarity among genetic and rare diseases (GARD) that are presenting similar clinical manifestations, and support further data harmonization. Objective To support rare disease data harmonization, we aim to systematically identify phenotypically similar GARD diseases from a disease-oriented integrative knowledge graph and determine their similarity types. Methods We identified phenotypically similar GARD diseases programmatically with 2 methods: (1) We measured disease similarity by comparing disease mappings between GARD and other rare disease resources, incorporating manual assessment; 2) we derived clinical manifestations presenting among sibling diseases from disease classifications and prioritized the identified similar diseases based on their phenotypes and genotypes. Results For disease similarity comparison, approximately 87% (341/392) identified, phenotypically similar disease pairs were validated; 80% (271/392) of these disease pairs were accurately identified as phenotypically similar based on similarity score. The evaluation result shows a high precision (94%) and a satisfactory quality (86% F measure). By deriving phenotypical similarity from Monarch Disease Ontology (MONDO) and Orphanet disease classification trees, we identified a total of 360 disease pairs with at least 1 shared clinical phenotype and gene, which were applied for prioritizing clinical relevance. A total of 662 phenotypically similar disease pairs were identified and will be applied for GARD data harmonization. Conclusions We successfully identified phenotypically similar rare diseases among the GARD diseases via 2 approaches, disease mapping comparison and phenotypical similarity derivation from disease classification systems. The results will not only direct GARD data harmonization in expanding translational science research but will also accelerate data transparency and consistency across different disease resources and terminologies, helping to build a robust and up-to-date knowledge resource on rare diseases.",

    "abstract": "Motivation Experimental findings on genetic disease mechanisms are scattered throughout the literature and represented in many ways, including unstructured text, cartoons, pathway diagrams, and network graphs. Integration and structuring of such mechanistic information will greatly enhance its utility. Results MecCog is a graphical framework for building integrated representations (mechanism schemas) of mechanisms by which a genetic variant causes a disease phenotype. A MecCog mechanism schema displays the propagation of system perturbations across stages of biological organization, using graphical notations to symbolize perturbed entities and activities, hyperlinked evidence tagging, a mechanism ontology, and depiction of knowledge gaps, ambiguities, and uncertainties. The web platform enables a user to construct, store, publish, browse, query, and comment on schemas. MecCog facilitates the identification of potential biomarkers, therapeutic intervention sites, and critical future experiments. Availability and Implementation The MecCog framework is freely available at http://www.meccog.org.

    "abstract": "Drug repurposing is an effective means for rapid drug discovery. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a computational methodology based on Literature-Wide Association Studies (LWAS) of PubMed to repurpose existing drugs for a rare inflammatory breast cancer (IBC). We have developed a methodology that conducted LWAS based on the text mining technology Word2Vec. 3.80 million \u201ccancer\u201d-related PubMed abstracts were processed as the corpus for Word2Vec to derive vector representation of biological concepts. These vectors for drugs and diseases served as the foundation for creating similarity maps of drugs and diseases, respectively, which were then employed to find potential therapy for IBC. Three hundred and thirty-six (336) known drugs and three hundred and seventy (370) diseases were expressed as vectors in this study. Nine hundred and seventy (970) previously known drug-disease association pairs among these drugs and diseases were used as the reference set. Based on the hypothesis that similar drugs can be used against similar diseases, we have identified 18 diseases similar to IBC, with 24 corresponding known drugs proposed to be the repurposing therapy for IBC. The literature search confirmed most known drugs tested for IBC, with four of them being novel candidates. We conclude that LWAS based on the Word2Vec technology is a novel approach to drug repurposing especially useful for rare diseases.",

    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus two (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, represents an unprecedented global health challenge. Consequently, a large amount of research into the disease pathogenesis and potential treatments has been carried out in a short time frame. However, developing novel drugs is a costly and lengthy process, and is unlikely to deliver a timely treatment for the pandemic. Drug repurposing, by contrast, provides an attractive alternative, as existing drugs have already undergone many of the regulatory requirements. In this work we used a combination of network algorithms and human curation to search integrated knowledge graphs, identifying drug repurposing opportunities for COVID-19. We demonstrate the value of this approach, reporting on eight potential repurposing opportunities identified, and discuss how this approach could be incorporated into future studies.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the genetic and molecular underpinnings of diseases is of crucial importance in biology and could provide valuable insights that help in the development of therapeutics against human diseases. However, predicting the genetic and molecular players in a given disease is a technically difficult task. Recent developments in graph and network analysis have provided computational tools for this task. Many previous attempts have leveraged existing molecular networks such as protein-protein interaction networks to predict disease nodes. We build on their successes by (a) augmenting molecular networks via incorporation of literature-derived data (b) enriching the graph with biologically-relevant molecular features, and (c) analyzing performance of recently developed graph algorithms such as GraphSage that utilize graph structure and node features to allow for the generation of high-quality embeddings useful in disease prediction. We show that while GNBR and PP-Decagon datasets had similar performance, their combined performance was lower than using independently, suggesting that more work and thought may be required in combining heterogeneous datasets. Further, our project data generated two key-insights: (a) incorporation of molecular node features in the PP-Decagon dataset nearly doubles predictive performance and (b) GraphSage performs comparably Graph Convolutional Networks. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first group to incorporate UniProt features in predicting disease labels on a PPI network. These results suggest promising new avenues of inquiry.",

    "abstract": "The compelling applications of Low earth orbit (LEO) satellite networks in our daily lives have been witnessed in recent years, ranging from weather forecasts to military monitoring. LEO satellite networks have grown in importance as a complement to terrestrial networks aiming at delivering global, ubiquitous communication. However, due to the LEO network topology keeps changing dynamically, the development of efficient routing algorithms becomes one of the challenges in the LEO network. Traditional routing policies hardly solve the rerouting problem caused by link switchover and the high calculation cost caused by large-scale irregular satellite topology. In this paper, we propose a knowledge graph-aided representation of satellite network topologies and routing architecture to optimize path selection and calculation cost for lower packet loss ratio and average delay. Moreover, we generate a routing policy by predicting potential relations between data packets and nodes to select the best relay nodes with the maximum probability of forwarding relations. Finally, extensive simulations are performed to evaluate the performance and availability of our proposed algorithm.",

    "abstract": "With the development of Industrial Internet of Things, the types and functions of components are increasing, the application environment is becoming more and more complex. Also, the quality management of components is becoming more and more important. In order to understand the knowledge related to component quality management more conveniently and build an intelligent system for component quality management, this paper proposes a method to construct component quality management knowledge graph based on BERT word embedding model and entity relationship joint extraction method based on annotation strategy. Combining entity extraction and relationship extraction parts into one not only reduces the consumption of computing resources, but also reduces the propagation of wrong entities. In this paper, the sequence to sequence model of Bert-BilSTm-CRF is adopted. Through the BERT word embedding layer, the context information can be better utilized and the accuracy of extraction can be improved. Experimental results show that compared with other classical deep learning term extraction models, this model has a significant improvement in accuracy, recall rate and F1 value.",

Analysing and providing a synthesis of the commonly used approaches to knowledge graph development would provide researchers and practitioners a better understanding of the overall process and methods involved. Hence, this article aims at defining the overall process of knowledge graph development and its key constituent steps. For this purpose, a systematic review and a conceptual analysis of the literature was conducted. The resulting process was compared to case studies to evaluate its applicability. The proposed process suggests a unified approach and provides guidance for both researchers and practitioners when constructing and managing knowledge graphs.",

    "abstract": "Information extraction (IE) is a challenging task, particularly when dealing with highly heterogeneous data. State-of-the-art data mining technologies struggle to process information from textual data. Therefore, various IE techniques have been developed to enable the use of IE for textual data. However, each technique differs from one another because it is designed for different data types and has different target information to be extracted. This study investigated and described the most contemporary methods for extracting information from textual data, emphasizing their benefits and shortcomings. To provide a holistic view of the domain, this comprehensive systematic literature review employed a systematic mapping process to summarize studies published in the last six years (from 2017 to 2022). It covers fundamental concepts, recent approaches, applications, and trends, in addition to challenges and future research prospects in this domain area. Based on an analysis of 161 selected studies, we found that the state-of-the-art models employ deep learning to extract information from textual data. Finally, this study aimed to guide novice and experienced researchers in future research and serve as a foundation for this research area.",

    "abstract": "The continuous progress of society and the vigorous development of science and technology have brought people the dawn of maintaining health and preventing and controlling diseases. At the same time, with the update and iteration of bioinformatics technology, the current biological gene research has also undergone revolutionary changes. However, a long-standing problem in genetic research has always plagued researchers, that is, how to find the most needed sample genes from a large number of sample genes, so as to reduce unnecessary research and reduce research costs. By studying the extraction path of biological genes, it can help researchers to extract the most valuable research genes and avoid wasting time and energy. In order to solve the above problems, this paper used the Bhattacharyya distance index and the Gini index to screen the sample genes when extracting the characteristic genes of breast cancer. In the selected 49 public genes, 6 principal components were extracted by principal component analysis (PCA), and finally the experimental results were tested. It was found that when the optimal number of characteristic genes was selected as 5, the recognition rate of genes reached the highest 90.31%, which met the experimental requirements. In addition, the experiment also proved that the characteristic gene extraction method designed in this paper had a removal rate of 99.75% of redundant genes, which can greatly reduce the time and money cost of research.",

Traditional domain-specific knowledge graph relation construction requires manual construction by experts familiar with the relevant domain, which is heavily labor cost consuming. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a knowledge graph relation construction model ASRC based on active learning and semantic recognition, which consists of relation existence mining module and relation category prediction module. ASRC is training to mine entity pairs with possible relation, and recommends the entity pairs to experts for relation labeling, and then predicts the specific category of relation. ASRC improves model quality through multiple iterations, and more relation annotation can be labeled with the same number of annotations compared to randomly selected entity pairs.",

    "abstract": "The knowledge graph was first used in the information search of the Internet as a way to improve the quality of the search because it contains a huge amount of structured knowledge data. In this paper, the knowledge map algorithm is studied through natural language processing technology and probabilistic fuzzy information aggregation, and the knowledge map completion algorithm is cognitive-fitted. NLP is natural language processing. Based on the experiments in this paper, it can be seen that, after combining the algorithm, the behavior data set of 1000 Amazon users was analyzed, and it can be found that the accuracy of the algorithm improves as the proportion of data in the experiment increases. Among them, the 10% dataset has a correct rate of 0.66; the 30% dataset has a final accuracy rate of 0.68; and the 50% dataset has a final accuracy rate of 0.70. The experimental results of this paper show that using probabilistic fuzzy information aggregation and natural language processing technology as a way to complete the knowledge graph can improve the accuracy of the operation. It plays an important role in the development of intelligent cognition and search engines.",

    "title": "ERDERP: Entity and Relation Double Embedding on Relation Hyperplanes and Relation Projection Hyperplanes",
    "abstract": "Since data are gradually enriched over time, knowledge graphs are inherently imperfect. Thus, knowledge graph completion is proposed to perfect knowledge graph by completing triples. Currently, a family of translation models has become the most effective method for knowledge graph completion. These translation models are modeled to solve the complexity and diversity of entities, such as one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many, which ignores the diversity of relations themselves, such as multiple relations between a pair of entities. As a result, with current translation models, it is difficult to effectively extract the semantic information of entities and relations. To effectively extract the semantic information of the knowledge graph, this paper fundamentally analyzes the complex relationships of the knowledge graph. Then, considering the diversity of relations themselves, the complex relationships are refined as one-to-one-to-many, many-to-one-to-one, one-to-many-to-one, many-to-one-to-many, many-to-many-to-one, one-to-many-to-many, and many-to-many-to-many. By analyzing the complex relationships, a novel knowledge graph completion model, entity and relation double embedding on relation hyperplanes and relation projection hyperplanes (ERDERP), is proposed to extract the semantic information of entities and relations. First, ERDERP establishes a relation hyperplane for each relation and projects the relation embedding into the relation hyperplane. Thus, the semantic information of the relations is extracted effectively. Second, ERDERP establishes a relation projection hyperplane for each relation projection and projects entities into relation projection hyperplane. Thus, the semantic information of the entities is extracted effectively. Moreover, it is theoretically proved that ERDERP can solve antisymmetric problems. Finally, the proposed ERDERP are compared with several typical knowledge graph completion models. The experimental results show that ERDERP is significantly effective in link prediction, especially in relation prediction. For instance, on FB15k and FB15k-237, Hits@1 of ERDERP outperforms TransH at least 30%.",

As a representation of semantic relations between entities, KGs have proven to be particularly relevant for natural language processing (NLP), experiencing a rapid spread and wide adoption within recent years. Given the increasing amount of research work in this area, several KG-related approaches have been surveyed in the NLP research community. However, a comprehensive study that categorizes established topics and reviews the maturity of individual research streams remains absent to this day. Contributing to closing this gap, we systematically analyzed 507 papers from the literature on KGs in NLP. Our survey encompasses a multifaceted review of tasks, research types, and contributions. As a result, we present a structured overview of the research landscape, provide a taxonomy of tasks, summarize our findings, and highlight directions for future work.",

Therefore, big data analysis has recently aroused great interest and curiosity among scientists in various fields. The powerful data organization and visualization capabilities of CiteSpace software is an effective way to achieve this goal. Chromitite is a strategic mineral resource of global importance with several industrial applications, including steel manufacturing. Research on chromitite has not only had high economic significance, but also has important scientific value. An understanding of chromitite can be used to obtain insight into the processes operating deep within the crust and mantle. However, no big-data analysis has been performed on chromitite-related publications; hence, the evolution of various views over time is unclear. The purpose of this study was to rapidly assess and summarize the development of research in the field, and to identify and briefly describe current research developments. The CiteSpace software was used to reveal research hotspots and predict future trends. The results of the co-occurrence network analysis indicate an active collaboration among current chromitite researchers, and the countries and institutions in which they are based. Hot research topics include a focus on podiform chromitite, the origin of chromitites, and the co-occurrence of platinum group elements (PGE). The main subject of current research is podiform chromitite containing ultrahigh-pressure minerals, which will help to elucidate the relationship between chromitite and the deep processes within the earth.",

At present, geological texts contain a large number of unregistered geological terms, and the existing rule\u2010based methods and machine\u2010learning and deep learning algorithms still cannot be used to solve the problem of word segmentation in geosciences, especially for the large number of unregistered words. In this study, we propose GeoBERTSegmenter, which is a GeoBERT\u2010based (Geoscience\u2010Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers) CWS model that is specifically designed with various linguistic irregularities in mind. In this method, a general model is extended to a BERT bidirectional recurrent neural network (BiLSTM) and conditional random field (GeoBERT + BiLSTM + CRF) model with a number of features designed to address the CWS task in geological text. We also train a pretrained language model named GeoBERT on a geological domain that is based on a large amount of Chinese geological text. In open testing, a precision of 94.77%, recall of 96.31% and F1 of 95.44%, are obtained, indicating that the proposed strategy performs much better than alternative methods in our study. In this study, unregistered geological terms can be effectively identified, and the recognition rate of common words is ensured, which lays the foundation for natural language processing in the domain of geoscience through Chinese text word segmentation.",

    "title": "Knowledge graph of alpine skiing events: A focus on meteorological conditions",
    "abstract": "Alpine skiing, as an outdoor winter sport, is particularly vulnerable to the variation of meteorological conditions. Scattered and multi-source big data cannot be fully utilized to conduct effective decision analyses by conventional data analysis methods. Presently, knowledge graphs are the most advanced organization form of knowledge base, which can make explicit the complex relationships among different objects. Thus, introducing knowledge graph to the event management of alpine skiing is significant to improve the ability of risk prediction and decision-making. In this research, we analyze the components and dynamic characteristics of alpine skiing, and construct an \u201cObject-Characteristic-Relation\u201d representation model to express multi-level knowledge. Moreover, we propose a \u201cCharacteristic-value- Relationship\u201d representation method based on the multi-source data, to construct the knowledge graph of alpine skiing. With the proposed method, comprehensive relationships between meteorological conditions and alpine skiing can be represented clearly, and support further knowledge reasoning for the event management under meteorological conditions. We have tested the utility of the proposed method in a case study of 2018 Winter Olympics in PyeongChang. The case study realizes an semi-automatic construction of knowledge graph for alpine skiing, provides decision supports for event risk managements, according to different meteorological conditions, and grounds a foundation for future knowledge graph construction of other large-scale sport events.",

    "title": "A Knowledge Graph Approach towards Re-structuring of Scientific Articles",
    "abstract": "With expedition of huge number of research articles published in each domain, retrieval of relevant articles based on researcher's interest and requirement have become challenging. Further, there are circumstances where a researcher may not get the specific information sought after, regardless of whether it is there in the document collection. This is since the article in database is structured only based on title and citation data while the conceptual information and algorithms described inside an article are disregarded. In this work, we propose a useful methodology for re-structuring documents in the database by considering the document as a whole and representing the keywords and key-phrases extracted from the article data using Knowledge Graphs. Clustering of nodes of graph segregate articles into different domains and sub-domains. Knowledge graph is further explored to identify most important documents using modularity and then the documents are sorted based on relevance. Thus, proper structuring of the documents helps the researchers to recognize applicable content from a large database in short span of time since database associated with the query system is improvised. This technique is beneficial to all the researchers who are trying to resolve a problem by identifying apt documents for information need.",

    "abstract": "(1) Background: Geological surveying is undergoing a digital transformation process towards the adoption of intelligent methods in China. Cognitive intelligence methods, such as those based on knowledge graphs and machine reading, have made progress in many domains and also provide a technical basis for quality detection in unstructured lithographic description texts. (2) Methods: First, the named entities and the relations of the domain-specific knowledge graph of petrography were defined based on the petrographic theory. Second, research was carried out based on a manually annotated corpus of petrographic description. The extraction of N-ary and single-entity overlapping relations and the separation of complex entities are key steps in this process. Third, a petrographic knowledge graph was formulated based on prior knowledge. Finally, the consistency between knowledge triples extracted from the corpus and the petrographic knowledge graph was calculated. The 1:50,000 sheet of Fengxiangyi located in the Dabie orogenic belt was selected for the empirical research. (3) Results: Using machine reading and the knowledge graph, petrographic knowledge can be extracted and the knowledge consistency calculation can quickly detect description errors about textures, structures and mineral components in petrographic description. (4) Conclusions: The proposed framework can be used to realise the intelligent inspection of petrographic knowledge with complex entities and relations and to improve the quality of petrographic description texts effectively.",

    "title": "Design of Knowledge Graph Retrieval System for Legal and Regulatory Framework of Multilevel Latent Semantic Indexing",
    "abstract": "Latent semantic analysis (LSA) is a natural language statistical model, which is considered as a method to acquire, generalize, and represent knowledge. Compared with other retrieval models based on concept dictionaries or concept networks, the retrieval model based on LSA has the advantages of strong computability and less human participation. LSA establishes a latent semantic space through truncated singular value decomposition. Words and documents in the latent semantic space are projected onto the dimension representing the latent concept, and then the semantic relationship between words can be extracted to present the semantic structure in natural language. This paper designs the system architecture of the public prosecutorial knowledge graph. Combining the graph data storage technology and the characteristics of the public domain ontology, a knowledge graph storage method is designed. By building a prototype system, the functions of knowledge management, knowledge query, and knowledge push are realized. A named entity recognition method based on bidirectional long-short-term memory (bi-LSTM) combined with conditional random field (CRF) is proposed. Bi-LSTM-CRF performs named entity recognition based on character-level features. CRF can use the transition matrix to further obtain the relationship between each position label, so that bi-LSTM-CRF not only retains the context information but also considers the influence between the current position and the previous position. The experimental results show that the LSTM-entity-context method proposed in this paper improves the representation ability of text semantics compared with other algorithms. However, this method only introduces relevant entity information to supplement the semantic representation of the text. The order in the case is often ignored, especially when it comes to the time series of the case characteristics, and the \u201corder problem\u201d may eventually affect the final prediction result. The knowledge graph of legal documents of theft cases based on ontology can be updated and maintained in real time. The knowledge graph can conceptualize, share, and perpetuate knowledge related to procuratorial organs and can also reasonably utilize and mine many useful experiences and knowledge to assist in decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Large transformer-based language models have achieved incredible success at various tasks which require narrative comprehension, including story completion, answering questions about stories, and generating stories ex nihilo. However, due to the limitations of finite context windows, these language models struggle to produce or understand stories longer than several thousand tokens. In order to mitigate the document length limitations that come with finite context windows, we introduce a novel architecture that augments story processing with an external dynamic knowledge graph. In contrast to static commonsense knowledge graphs which hold information about the real world, these dynamic knowledge graphs reflect facts extracted from the story being processed. Our architecture uses these knowledge graphs to create information-rich prompts which better facilitate story comprehension than prompts composed only of story text. We apply our architecture to the tasks of question answering and story completion. To complement this line of research, we introduce two long-form question answering tasks, LF-SQuAD and LF-QUOREF, in which the document length exceeds the size of the language model's context window, and introduce a story completion evaluation method that bypasses the stochastic nature of language model generation. We demonstrate broad improvement over typical prompt formulation methods for both question answering and story completion using GPT-2, GPT-3 and XLNet.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Texts have become an important spatial data resource. Interpretation of unstructured geoscience texts using natural language processing methods can effectively facilitate the discovery and retrieval of geographic information. Yet studies on the extraction of spatial information from textual geoscience data are limited compared to digital geoscience data. In this work, a machine learning approach is proposed for mining spatial relations in Chinese geological texts. The approach views spatial relation extraction as a sequence labeling problem, avoids the division of relation categories, and enables mining fine-grained spatial relations. The extracted geological texts commonly describe three-dimensional spatial relations among regions, strata, and lithologies. The extracted spatial relations are classified into three major categories (topological relations, absolute directional relations and relative directional relations) and 14 subcategories. We validated the proposed model with a test dataset, constructed visual displays of the extracted spatial relations on different topics, and quantified the uncertainty in the process from spatial entity recognition to spatial relation extraction. With the detailed portrayal of these spatial relations, this study provides support for solving theoretical and practical problems of cognition, prediction, decision-making, and evaluation in geoscience.",

    "abstract": "With the era of big data, the prediction and evaluation of geological mineral resources have gradually entered into a new stage from digital prospecting to intelligent prospecting. The theoretical method of big data mining can contribute to deep mineral resource prediction and evaluation. This paper extracts ore-causing and ore-caused anomaly information based on text intelligent mining technology, and constructs a regional conceptual prospecting model based on geological prospecting big data. First, we set up a corpus based on text big data discovery and preprocessing technology. Second, we used CNN multiple scale text classification technology to analyze geological text data from the two main aspects: ore-causing anomalies and ore-caused anomalies. Third, we used a statistical method to analyze the semantic links between content-words, and we constructed chord diagrams and ternary diagrams to visualize the content-words and their links. Finally, we constructed a regional conceptual prospecting model based on the knowledge graphs.",

    "abstract": "This paper defines the data schema of the multimodal knowledge graph, that is, the definition of entity types and relationships between entities. The knowledge point entities are defined as three types of structures, algorithms, and related terms, speech is also defined as one type of entities, and six semantic relationships are defined between entities. This paper adopts a named entity recognition model that combines bidirectional long short-term memory network and convolutional neural network, combines local information and global information of text, uses conditional random field algorithm to label feature sequences, and combines domain dictionary. A knowledge evaluation method based on triplet context information is designed, which combines triplet context information (internal relationship path information in knowledge graph and external text information related to entities in triplet) through knowledge representation learning. The knowledge of triples is evaluated. The knowledge evaluation ability of the English online homework evaluation system was evaluated on the knowledge graph noise detection task, the knowledge graph completion task (entity link prediction task), and the triplet classification task. The experimental results show that the English online homework evaluation system has good noise processing ability and knowledge credibility calculation ability, and has a stronger evaluation ability for low-noise data. Using the online homework platform to implement personalized English homework is conducive to improving students' homework mood, and students' \u201chappy\u201d homework mood has been significantly improved. The implementation of English personalized homework based on the online homework platform is conducive to improving students' homework initiative. With the help of the online homework platform to implement personalized English homework, students' homework time has been reduced, and the homework has been completed well, achieving the purpose of \u201creducing burden and increasing efficiency.\u201d",

    "abstract": "In the age of big data, the prediction and evaluation of geological mineral resources have gradually entered a new stage, intelligent prospecting. This review briefly summarizes the research development of textual data mining and spatial data mining. It is considered that the current research on mineral resource prediction has integrated logical reasoning, theoretical models, computational simulations, and other scientific research models, and has gradually advanced toward a new model. This type of new model has tried to mine unknown and effective knowledge from big data by intelligent analysis methods. However, many challenges have come forward, including four aspects: (i) discovery of prospecting big data based on geological knowledge system; (ii) construction of the conceptual prospecting model by intelligent text mining; (iii) mineral prediction by intelligent spatial big data mining; (iv) sharing and visualization of the mineral prediction data. By extending the geological analysis in the process of prospecting prediction to the logical rules associated with expert knowledge points, the theory and methods of intelligent mineral prediction were preliminarily established based on geological big data. The core of the theory is to promote the flow, invocation, circulation, and optimization of the three key factors of \u201cknowledge\u201d, \u201cmodel\u201d, and \u201cdata\u201d, and to preliminarily constitute the prototype of intelligent linkage mechanisms. It could be divided into four parts: intelligent datamation, intelligent informatization, intelligent knowledgeization, and intelligent servitization.",

    "abstract": "Volcanic activity may influence climate parameters and impact people safety, and hence monitoring its characteristic indicators and their temporal evolution is crucial. Several databases, communications and literature providing data, information and updates on active volcanoes worldwide are available, and will likely increase in the future. Consequently, information extraction and text mining techniques aiming to efficiently analyze such databases and gather data and parameters of interest on a specific volcano can play an important role in this applied science field. This work presents a natural language processing (NLP) system that we developed to extract geochemical and geophysical data from free unstructured text included in monitoring reports and operational bulletins issued by volcanological observatories in HTML, PDF and MS Word formats. The NLP system enables the extraction of relevant gas parameters (e.g., SO2 and CO2 flux) from the text, and was tested on a series of 2839 daily and weekly bulletins published online between 2015 and 2021 for the Stromboli volcano (Italy). The experiment shows that the system proves capable in the extraction of the time series of a set of user-defined parameters that can be later analyzed and interpreted by specialists in relation with other monitoring and geospatial data. The text mining system can potentially be tuned to extract other target parameters from this and other databases.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The unified management and planning of national or provincial natural resources distributed both aboveground and underground have become increasingly important. Accurate depictions of natural resource elements and their interactions are key to achieving integrated and systematic management of natural resources. However, current spatiotemporal data models are based only on data descriptions, attribute records, and other model knowledge of a more general basis, without intuitively describing relationships between these elements and natural resources. This paper, therefore, proposes an integrated data-model-knowledge representation model to explicitly describe the time, space, and interaction of natural resource entities through an integrated knowledge graph. First, this study constructs a conceptual model using the aspects of semantics, scale, and data-model-knowledge, thereby explicitly describing the relationships of natural resources. Second, a logical model of natural resource representation is proposed, that is integrated with time, space, attributes, and relationships. Finally, taking the management of water resources as an example, this paper realizes the meticulous presentation of the levels of detail and rich semantic relations of natural resource entities. The findings of this study lay the foundation for a more efficient, precise, and lucid perception of the distribution laws and complicated interactional relationships of natural resources, both aboveground and underground.",

    "title": "Exploring the construction and application of spatial scene knowledge graphs considering topological relations",
    "abstract": "A spatial scene consists of a large number of geographic objects and their spatial relations and attributes. It is important to explore an effective method to organize spatial scenes so that they are more readable by humans and machines. The construction of a spatial scene knowledge graph considering topological relations, which can play important roles in spatial query, spatial analysis, and spatial data modeling, is explored in this article. To construct the spatial scene knowledge graph considering topological relations, the definitions of the spatial scene knowledge graph schema, topological relation knowledge acquisition and storage, and spatial scene knowledge graph visualization are explored. Two typical applications, including knowledge reasoning and spatial neighbor analysis based on spatial scene knowledge graphs, are presented. A case study is designed, and the construction and application of a spatial scene knowledge graph of the Three Gorges Reservoir Region is shown. Nine contains relations, 18 crosses relations, and 47 touches relations are marked; and topological relation reasoning and spatial neighbor relation analysis based on a successfully constructed knowledge graph are performed. The results show the following: (1) the spatial scene knowledge graph considering topological relations is an effective and intuitive way to express the topological relations between geographic objects; and (2) the spatial scene knowledge graph may play important roles in graph\u2010based application areas, such as topological relation reasoning and spatial neighbor analysis.",

    "title": "Chinese Named Entity Recognition in the Geoscience Domain Based on BERT",
    "abstract": "Geological reports are frequently used by geologists involved in geological surveys and scientific research to record the results and outcomes of geological surveys. With such a rich data source, a substantial amount of knowledge has yet to be mined and analyzed. This paper focuses on automatically information extraction from geological reports, namely, geological named entity recognition. Geological named entity recognition has an important role in data mining, knowledge discovery and Knowledge graph construction. Existing general named entity recognition models/tools are limited in the domain of geoscience due to the various language irregularities associated with geological text, such as informal sentence structures, several domain\u2010geoscience words, large character lengths and multiple combinations of independent words. We present Bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT)\u2010(Bidirectional gated recurrent unit network) BiGRU\u2010 (Conditional random field) CRF, which is a deep learning\u2010based geological named entity recognition model that is designed specifically with these linguistic irregularities in mind. Based on the pretrained language model, an integrated deep learning model incorporating BERT, BiGRU and CRF is constructed to obtain character vectors rich in semantic information through the BERT pretrained language model to alleviate for the lack of specificity of static word vectors (e.g., word2vec) and to improve the extraction capability of complex geological entities. We demonstrate our proposed model by applying it to four test datasets, including a geoscience NER data set from regional geological reports, and by comparing its performance with those of five baseline models.",

    "abstract": "The knowledge graph connects real-world entities and concepts through their relationships, connects all different types of information to obtain a relationship network, and can analyze \u201crelationship\u201d issues. Creating a knowledge graph is a continuous process, and it needs to continuously learn new knowledge and update existing knowledge in the library as time and events change. However, since the accuracy of the updated new knowledge cannot be guaranteed, the new knowledge must be verified. This paper aims to study the knowledge verification method based on artificial intelligence-based knowledge graph construction. Based on the analysis of the knowledge graph construction process, the knowledge graph construction method and the knowledge verification method, knowledge verification is realized by constructing a probabilistic soft logic model. The experimental results show that the recall rate, F1 value, and AUC value of the candidate knowledge set are verified by the knowledge verification model proposed in this paper. Therefore, it can be inferred that the knowledge verification model proposed in this paper is effective.",

    "abstract": "Searching, reading, and finding information from the massive medical text collections are challenging. A typical biomedical search engine is not feasible to navigate each article to find critical information or keyphrases. Moreover, few tools provide a visualization of the relevant phrases to the query. However, there is a need to extract the keyphrases from each document for indexing and efficient search. The transformer-based neural networks\u2014BERT has been used for various natural language processing tasks. The built-in self-attention mechanism can capture the associations between words and phrases in a sentence. This research investigates whether the self-attentions can be utilized to extract keyphrases from a document in an unsupervised manner and identify relevancy between phrases to construct a query relevancy phrase graph to visualize the search corpus phrases on their relevancy and importance. The comparison with six baseline methods shows that the self-attention-based unsupervised keyphrase extraction works well on a medical literature dataset. This unsupervised keyphrase extraction model can also be applied to other text data. The query relevancy graph model is applied to the COVID-19 literature dataset and to demonstrate that the attention-based phrase graph can successfully identify the medical phrases relevant to the query terms.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Knowledge graphs (KGs) represent entities and relations as computable networks, which is of great value for discovering hidden knowledge and patterns. Geographic KGs mainly describe static facts and have difficulty representing changes, greatly limiting their application in geographic spatiotemporal processes. By analyzing the spatiotemporal features and evolution of geographic elements, this study presents the geographic evolutionary knowledge graph (GEKG). Its representation model has five core elements: time, geographic event (geo-event), geographic entity (geo-entity), activity and property, and defines six relations: logical, semantic, evolutionary and temporal relation, participation and inclusion. It establishes a hierarchical cubical model structure and each temporal layer extends vertically and horizontally starting with the earliest geo-event. Vertical expansion refers to the connection between different kinds of element, such as the participation relation between geo-entities and geo-events. Horizontal expansion indicates the association between the same kinds of element, such as the semantic relation between geo-entities. For different layers, the spatiotemporal differences of elements produce the evolutionary relation. Finally, the comparison of GEKG with Yet Another Great Ontology (YAGO) and Geographic Knowledge Graph (GeoKG) shows that GEKG has more advantages in representing geographic evolutionary knowledge, revealing the evolution mechanism of geographic elements and the evolutionary reasons.",

It consists of four major parts: 1) concepts relevant to KG and approaches for KG construction, 2) KG application in data collection, curation, and service, 3) KG application in data analysis, and 4) challenges and trends of geo-science KG creation and application in the near future. For each of the first three parts, a list of concepts, exemplar studies, and best practices are summarized. Those summaries are synthesized together in the challenge and trend analyses. As artificial intelligence and data science are thriving in geosciences, we hope this review of geoscience KGs can be of value to practitioners in data-intensive geoscience studies.",

    "title": "A Review on Intelligent Systems for Geosciences and Big data.",
    "abstract": "Geoscience is a vital social area that demands solutions to numerous pressing issues confronting humanity and the earth. As the geosciences enter the era of big data, machine learning (ML)\u2014which has been extensively successful in commercial domains\u2014offers enormous promise to help solve geosciences challenges. This article introduces machine learning (ML) researchers to the challenges posed by geoscience problems and the potential for both machine learning and geosciences advancement. We begin by highlighting common sources of geoscience data and outlining their shared characteristics. Data science is gaining traction across a broad range of geosciences fields and applications. To meet that requirement, this article presents a review from a data life cycle viewpoint. Numerous facets of the geosciences present unique difficulties for the study of intelligent systems. Geosciences data is notoriously difficult to analyze since it is frequently unpredictable, intermittent, sparse, multiresolution, and multiscale. The spatiotemporal boundaries of geosciences processes and objects are frequently amorphous. Due to the absence of ground truth, evaluating, testing, and comparing models becomes challenging. Overcoming these obstacles will need substantial advancements in intelligent systems, which will help the geosciences tremendously in turn. Numerous successful data-driven geoscience discoveries have been reported recently, and many geoscience conferences have begun to include geoinformatics and data science sessions. Across academia, industry, and government, there is a strong desire to learn more about the current state of data science in geoscience as well as its potential. To address that need, this article provides a review from a data life cycle perspective. The data life cycle's critical steps include concept generation, data collection, preprocessing, analysis, archiving, distribution, discovery, and repurposing. The first section discusses the fundamental concepts and theoretical underpinnings of data science, while the second section summarises key points and shareable experiences from existing publications centred on each stage of the data life cycle. Finally, a future vision for data science applications in geoscience is discussed, including topics such as open science, smart data, and team science science. We hope that this review will be beneficial to data science practitioners in the geoscience community and spark additional discussion about data science best practises and future trends in geoscience.",

    "abstract": "The medical information carried in electronic medical records has high clinical research value, and medical named entity recognition is the key to extracting valuable information from large-scale medical texts. At present, most of the studies on Chinese medical named entity recognition are based on character vector model or word vector model. Owing to the complexity and specificity of Chinese text, the existing methods may fail to achieve good performance. In this study, we propose a Chinese medical named entity recognition method that fuses character and word vectors. The method expresses Chinese texts as character vectors and word vectors separately and fuses them in the model for features. The proposed model can effectively avoid the problems of missing character vector information and inaccurate word vector partitioning. On the CCKS 2019 dataset for the named entity recognition task of Chinese electronic medical records, the proposed model achieves good performance and can effectively improve the accuracy of Chinese medical named entity recognition compared with other baseline models.",

    "abstract": "With the increasing volume of online geosciences data, geoscientists are now facing huge challenges in rapidly discovering and extracting valuable information from a large number of documents. Nowadays, it has become crucial to develop flexible and efficient tools that can help geoscientists to quickly navigate through unstructured texts to reveal hidden patterns and trends. This paper presents a workflow for the multidimensional analysis of geosciences literature. NLP techniques and ontologies are used to automatically identify and extract domain-specific concepts and entities buried in unstructured text. Based on these extracted data, we defined a multidimensional representation form of geosciences text documents which facilitates quantitative and exploratory analysis for knowledge discovery. To illustrate the potential of the proposed workflow, we implemented a pilot system that allows the user to perform multidimensional analysis on large collection of documents through interactive and user-friendly visualizations. We have analyzed the rare earth elements and carbonatites research topic as an example. The obtained visualizations show the usefulness and the efficiency of the proposed system for discovering knowledge and identifying potential research gaps.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge modeling is an important step in building knowledge\u2010based applications. Understanding the processes of knowledge modeling and the techniques involved can help developers to grasp the knowledge modeling task as a whole and improve the efficiency of execution and management of modeling tasks. However, previous reviews on knowledge modeling mainly focus on ontology\u2010based knowledge modeling. At present, there is no research work to summarize nonontology knowledge modeling methods, nor to systematically summarize the processes and techniques of knowledge modeling. In this paper, the processes, techniques, and characteristics of knowledge modeling methods based on ontology and nonontology are surveyed. Three research questions related to knowledge modeling are proposed. (1) What methods can be used for knowledge modeling? (2) What processes are involved in knowledge modeling? (3) What techniques are used in the processes of knowledge modeling? By answering these questions, the results of the survey help developers choose appropriate knowledge modeling methods in their work and complete modeling tasks effectively. Meanwhile, it is also conducive to the research work of improving knowledge modeling methods in the future.",

    "abstract": "The representing of a student\u2019s knowledge in an academic discipline plays an important role in boosting the student\u2019s skills. To support stakeholders in the educational domain, it is necessary to provide them with robust assessment strategies that facilitate the teaching-learning process. Student\u00b4s mastery is determined by the degree of knowledge, which demonstrates objectively, on the topics included in the different areas that make up an academic discipline. Although there is a wide variety of techniques to represent knowledge, particularly Knowledge Graph technique is becoming relevant due to the structured approach and benefits it offers. This paper proposes a method that classifies and weights the nodes (topics) of a Knowledge Graph of a disciplinary area, which is analyzed through a case study. The method has two approaches: avoid exhaustive evaluation of the nodes and weight the nodes with adequate precision. Method\u00b4s application is illustrated by a case study. As results, a Knowledge Graph is obtained with its classified and weighted nodes through the application of the proposed method, in which 100% of the topics have been impacted through the objective evaluation of 20.8% representing 10 nodes. It is concluded that the proposed method has potential to be used in the representation and management of knowledge, being necessary to improve phases\u2019 iteration to condition number of objective nodes.",

    "abstract": "As the amount of published geoscience literature grows, reading and summarizing texts of large collections has become a challenging task. Publication keywords can be considered basic components of knowledge structure representations and have been used to reveal knowledge concerning research domains. In contrast to data used in other research domains, the works on textual geoscience data that entail keyword extraction are limited. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised algorithm, the graph\u2010based keyword extractor with error\u2010feedback propagation (GKEEP), that enhances graph\u2010based keyword extraction approaches by using an error\u2010feedback mechanism similar to the concept of backpropagation. The proposed approach comprises the following steps. A preprocessed document is used as the input of the proposed model and is represented as a weighted undirected graph, where the vertices represent words and the edges represent the cooccurrence relationship between the words constrained by a window size. Subsequently, its nodes are ranked by their importance scores calculated by a graph\u2010based ranking algorithm. Consequently, all the words have their own scores, and they are used to compute the scores of keyword candidates. Subsequently, the Word2Vec method is applied to recalculate the scores of keyword candidates and rank the keyword candidates to select the final keyword. It also utilizes error feedback to boost the rankings of the most salient terms that would otherwise be deemed less important. With empirical experiments on two real data sets (including our newly built data set), the proposed GKEEP model outperforms state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art unsupervised models and the existing graph\u2010based ranking models. The proposed method can effectively reflect intrinsic keyword semantics and interrelationships.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces evolutionary game theory as an analysis tool to study the evolution of the cooperative behavior of nodes in the opportunistic network. At the same time, considering the spatial distribution of nodes in the opportunistic network and the corresponding cooperative interaction relationship, the evolutionary graph theory is further applied to study the cooperative behavior in the context of considering the network space. In the collaboration model of this article, the vertices in the evolutionary graph theory are used to represent the nodes in the network, and the edges in the graph represent that the node pairs are within the communication range of each other. The node will play a game with neighboring nodes according to the payout matrix. Through repeated games between nodes, the network reaches a relatively stable final state, and the distribution of nodes with different behaviors in the final state of the network is checked. By adjusting the network parameters, we can analyze the distribution and evolution of cooperation in the network, and study the stability of the network. We realize the credible collaborative evolutionary game model by building a comprehensive simulation platform and verify its effectiveness and scalability. We design and implement an evolutionary game model independent of routing protocols, so that the model can be quickly deployed in traditional routing protocols. Subsequently, simulations verified that the reputation model played a role in guiding nodes to actively participate in network collaboration during the collaborative evolution process. And the greater the strength of the reputation incentive mechanism, the better the effect of the evolutionary model. The evolution model is deployed in multiple routing protocols, verifying that the model can play a role in different routing protocols. In addition, the evolution model can also play a role in different network environments and has good scalability.",

    "abstract": "In the field of electric power, there is a scarcity of data related to the entity relationship of power safety regulations, and the types of entity relationships in the text data of power safety regulations are too complicated, and the task of extracting the relationships between power safety entities is relatively complex. In response to the above problems, this paper proposes a remote supervision relationship extraction method based on deep residual learning (Res) combined with multi-level attention mechanism. Firstly, according to the word vector and word position vector as input, the PCNN model is used to extract the semantic features of the text, and the deep residual is used to learn less the influence of noise data to better extract the deep semantic features of the power safety text sentence. Secondly, the multi-level attention mechanism is used to calculate the correlation between the corresponding entity and the context word, so as to assign different weights to different entity features and reduce the weight of noise data. Finally, through the attention mechanism of the relationship layer, it automatically learns the dependency and inclusion relationships between different relationships, and uses the softmax function to predict entity relationships. The analysis of simulation examples proves the effectiveness of the method in this paper.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In this work we have proposed a model for Citizen Profiling. It uses veillance (Surveillance and Sousveillance) for data acquisition. For representation of Citizen Profile Temporal Knowledge Graph has been used through which we can answer semantic queries. Previously, most of the work lacks representation of Citizen Profile and have used surveillance for data acquisition. Our contribution is towards enriching the data acquisition process by adding sousveillance mechanism and facilitating semantic queries through representation of Citizen Profiles using Temporal Knowledge Graphs. Our proposed solution is storage efficient as we have only stored data logs for Citizen Profiling instead of storing images, audio, and video for profiling purposes. Our proposed system can be extended to Smart City, Smart Traffic Management, Workplace profiling etc. Agent based mechanism can be used for data acquisition where each Citizen has its own agent. Another improvement can be to incorporate a decentralized version of database for maintaining Citizen profile.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Historical maps contain rich geographic information about the past of a region. They are sometimes the only source of information before the availability of digital maps. Despite their valuable content, it is often challenging to access and use the information in historical maps, due to their forms of paper-based maps or scanned images. It is even more time-consuming and labor-intensive to conduct an analysis that requires a synthesis of the information from multiple historical maps. To facilitate the use of the geographic information contained in historical maps, one way is to build a geographic knowledge graph (GKG) from them. This paper proposes a general workflow for completing one important step of building such a GKG, namely aligning the same geographic entities from different maps. We present this workflow and the related methods for implementation, and systematically evaluate their performances using two different datasets of historical maps. The evaluation results show that machine learning and deep learning models for matching place names are sensitive to the thresholds learned from the training data, and a combination of measures based on string similarity, spatial distance, and approximate topological relation achieves the best performance with an average F-score of 0.89.",

    "abstract": "Data science receives increasing attention in a variety of geoscience disciplines and applications. Many successful data-driven geoscience discoveries have been reported recently, and the number of geoinformatics and data science sessions have begun to increase in many geoscience conferences. Across academia, industry, and governmental sectors, there is a strong interest to know more about the current progress as well as the potential of data science for geoscience. To address that need, this article provides a review from the perspective of a data life cycle. The key steps in the data life cycle includes concept, collection, preprocessing, analysis, archive, distribution, discovery, and repurpose. Those subjects are intuitive and easy to follow even for geoscientists with very limited experience of cyberinfrastructure, statistics, and machine learning. The review includes two key parts. The first is about the fundamental concepts and theoretical foundation of data science, and the second is the summary of highlights and sharable experience from existing publications centered on each step in the data life cycle. At the end, a vision about the future trends of data science applications in geoscience is discussed, including topics on open science, smart data, and science of team science. We hope this review will be useful to data science practitioners in the geoscience community, and will lead to more discussions on the best practices and future trends of data science for",

    "abstract": "The rapid increase in the number of chemical science literature has brought challenges to researchers in search and data analysis. For many chemical scientific literature, extracting information from text and using knowledge is the focus of research. However, the existing Chinese text word segmentation methods have low recognition rate for chemical terms. The reason is that the addition of many new vocabulary and mixed professional vocabulary of Chinese and English brings challenges to word segmentation. In this paper, we propose a word segmentation method of Chinese chemical literature based on hybrid feature fusion learning Model(HFFLM). HFFLM first establishes chemical science corpus (Chem-pku) to train Chinese word segmentation (CWS) tasks. In addition, HFFLM uses BiLSTM and CNN to extract document features and fuse them. Then, HFFLM combines boundary features to construct conditional random field to train the end-to-end CWS model. In the end, HFFLM makes visual analysis of the word segmentation results. The experimental results indicate that HFFLM has high accuracy and recall rate, and is suitable for chemical industry vocabulary extraction with mixed Chinese and English.",

    "abstract": "To solve the problems that the business data in state grid corporation cannot be crossed professionally, and the data resources cannot be intelligently analyzed and managed, this paper proposes a knowledge graph construction method oriented for heterogeneous data sources. On the basis of multi-source data from marketing management system (MBS), production management system (PMS), geographical information system (GIS) collected by the big data technology, the semantic annotation method is used to extract the knowledge entities, attributions and relations from the structured, semi-structured and unstructured data firstly. Secondly, the knowledge graph is constructed through the knowledge fusion technology based on ontology fusion and instance fusion algorithms proposed in this paper. Finally, the ontology model for multi-source data is constructed. Experiments show that the proposed algorithms improve the matching degree and $F1$ score, and have better visualization ability.",

    "abstract": ": The correct topological relationship is crucial in the low-voltage distribution network, as the actual topological structure of the low-voltage distribution network changes frequently and tremendously due to the need of operation and maintenance, and it cannot be correctly reflected upon failure in timely updating of data, low circulation, poor quality etc. therefore, it is necessary to identify the topology. The knowledge graph technology can clearly reflect the existing relationship between data, deducing and mining hidden knowledge, suitable for topology identification of the low-voltage distribution network. In the study, the knowledge graph technology was employed for topology identification: firstly, analyse the construction method of the knowledge graph, integrate data in multiple low-voltage distribution network information systems based on the knowledge graph technology, deduce missing data, find out the relationship between data, and then build the knowledge graph of low-voltage distribution network topological structure, and finally, based on \u2018Typical Design Specification of Low-Voltage Distribution Network Infrastructure Project\u2019 and semantic segmentation, identify the user\u2013transformer relationship in low-voltage distribution network information system. The test results of the examples were very satisfactory, showing the theoretical values and practical application values of the identification method proposed in this study.",

    "abstract": "It is the phenotypic data of microbial taxonomy that is of great significance. It can be used not only for the identification of microbial taxonomy but also for the study of the interaction between human and the environment. There are bilstm-CRF, Bert-CRF and other models are commonly used for named entity recognition (NER) recently. However, these methods do not consider the sequence information of neurons and do not analyze the hierarchical structure of sentences. In the field of biological phenotypes, there are longer sentences and complex words, the named entity recognition with neural network performs not very well. Based on this, this paper proposed a new NER method which is named BERT-ON-LSTM to identify and extract microbial phenotypic entities from the literature. This paper improved the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (Bert) which enabled the model to learn the hierarchical structure information and be more sensitive to words that require long-term memory. And then, conditional random field (CRF) is used to decode since it can be calculated the joint probability distribution of the whole tag sequence. The experimental results on three data sets prove that our model is effective.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge Graph Construction (KGC) from text unlocks information held within unstructured text and is critical to a wide range of downstream applications. General approaches to KGC from text are heavily reliant on the existence of knowledge bases, yet most domains do not even have an external knowledge base readily available. In many situations this results in information loss as a wealth of key information is held within \u201cnon-entities\u201d. Domain-specific approaches to KGC typically adopt unsupervised pipelines, using carefully crafted linguistic and statistical patterns to extract co-occurred noun phrases as triples, essentially constructing text graphs rather than true knowledge graphs. In this research, for the first time, in the same flavour as Collobert et al.\u2019s seminal work of \u201cNatural language processing (almost) from scratch\u201d in 2011, we propose a Seq2KG model attempting to achieve \u201cKnowledge graph construction (almost) from scratch\u201d. An end-to-end Sequence to Knowledge Graph (Seq2KG) neural model jointly learns to generate triples and resolves entity types as a multi-label classification task through deep learning neural networks. In addition, a novel evaluation metric that takes both semantic and structural closeness into account is developed for measuring the performance of triple extraction. We show that our end-toend Seq2KG model performs on par with a state of the art rule-based system which outperformed other neural models and won the first prize of the first Knowledge Graph Contest in 2019. A new annotation scheme and three high-quality manually annotated datasets are available to help promote this direction of research.",

    "abstract": "Massive unstructured geoscience data are buried in geological reports. Geological text classification provides opportunities to leverage this wealth of data for geology and mineralization research. Existing studies of massive geoscience documents/reports have not provided effective classification results for further knowledge discovery and data mining and often lack adequate domain\u2010specific knowledge. In this paper, we present a novel and unified framework (namely, Dic\u2010Att\u2010BiLSTM) that combines domain\u2010specific knowledge and bidirectional long short\u2010term memory (BiLSTM) for effective geological text classification. Dic\u2010Att\u2010BiLSTM benefits from a matching strategy by incorporating domain\u2010specific knowledge developed based on geoscience ontology to grasp the linguistic geoscience clues. Furthermore, Dic\u2010Att\u2010BiLSTM brings together the capacity of a geoscience dictionary matching approach and an attention mechanism to construct a dictionary attention layer. Finally, the network framework of Dic\u2010Att\u2010BiLSTM can utilize domain\u2010specific knowledge and classify geological text automatically. Experimental verifications are conducted on two constructed data sets, and the results clearly indicate that Dic\u2010Att\u2010BiLSTM outperforms other state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art text classification models.",

    "abstract": "Constructing a knowledge graph of geological hazards literature can facilitate the reuse of geological hazards literature and provide a reference for geological hazard governance. Named entity recognition (NER), as a core technology for constructing a geological hazard knowledge graph, has to face the challenges that named entities in geological hazard literature are diverse in form, ambiguous in semantics, and uncertain in context. This can introduce difficulties in designing practical features during the NER classification. To address the above problem, this paper proposes a deep learning-based NER model; namely, the deep, multi-branch BiGRU-CRF model, which combines a multi-branch bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BiGRU) layer and a conditional random field (CRF) model. In an end-to-end and supervised process, the proposed model automatically learns and transforms features by a multi-branch bidirectional GRU layer and enhances the output with a CRF layer. Besides the deep, multi-branch BiGRU-CRF model, we also proposed a pattern-based corpus construction method to construct the corpus needed for the deep, multi-branch BiGRU-CRF model. Experimental results indicated the proposed deep, multi-branch BiGRU-CRF model outperformed state-of-the-art models. The proposed deep, multi-branch BiGRU-CRF model constructed a large-scale geological hazard literature knowledge graph containing 34,457 entities nodes and 84,561 relations.",

    "abstract": "The high-precision observation and measurement techniques have accelerated the rapid development of geoscience research in the past decades and have pro-duced large amounts of research outputs. Many findings and discoveries were recorded in the geological literature, which is regarded as unstructured data. For these data, traditional research methods have limited functions for integrating and mining them to make knowledge discovery. Text mining based on natural language processing (NLP) provides the necessary method and technology to analyze unstructured geological literature. In this book chapter, we will review the latest researches of text mining in the domain of geoscience and present results from a few case studies. The research includes three major parts: (1) structuralization of geological literature, (2) information extraction and visualization for geological literature, and (3) geological text mining to assist database construction and knowledge discovery.",

    "abstract": "Unlike English and other western languages, Chinese does not delimit words using white-spaces. Chinese Word Segmentation (CWS) is the crucial first step towards natural language processing. However, for the geoscience subject domain, the CWS problem remains unresolved with many challenges. Although traditional methods can be used to process geoscience documents, they lack the domain knowledge for massive geoscience documents. Considering the above challenges, this motivated us to build a segmenter specifically for the geoscience domain. Currently, most of the state-of-the-art methods for Chinese word segmentation are based on supervised learning, whose features are mostly extracted from a local context. In this paper, we proposed a framework for sequence learning by incorporating cyclic self-learning corpus training. Following this framework, we build the GeoSegmenter based on the Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) network model to perform Chinese word segmentation. It can gain a great advantage through iterations of the training data. Empirical experimental results on geoscience documents and benchmark datasets showed that geological documents can be identified, and it can also recognize the generic documents.",

In this paper, to formulate this approach, a weighted graph mining has been used to ensure the effectiveness of the feature extraction and computational efficiency; only the most effective graphs representing the maximum number of triangles based on a predefined relational criterion have been considered. The proposed novel technique is an amalgamation of the relation between words surrounding an aspect of the product and the lexicon-based connection among those words, which creates a relational triangle. A maximum number of a triangle covering an element has been accounted as a prime feature. The proposed algorithm performs more than three times better than TF-IDF within a limited set of data in analysis based on domain-specific data.

Analyzing and feature extracting valuable data from high dimensional dataset challenges the bounds of measurable methods and strategies. Conventional techniques in general have less performance while managing high dimensional datasets. Lower test size has consistently been an issue in measurable tests, which get bothered in high dimensional information due to more equivalent or higher component size than the quantity of tests. The intensity of any measurable test is legitimately relative to its capacity to lesser an invalid theory, and test size is a significant central factor in producing probabilities of errors for making substantial ends. Thus one of the effective methods for taking care of high dimensional datasets is by lessening its measurement through feature selection and extraction with the goal that substantial accurate data can be practically performed. Clustering is the act of finding hidden or comparable data in information. It is one of the most widely recognized techniques for realizing useful features where a weight is given to each feature without predefining the various classes. In any feature selection and extraction procedures, the three main considerations of concern are measurable exactness, model interpretability and computational multifaceted nature. For any classification model, it is important to ensure that the productivity of any of these three components isn't undermined. In this manuscript, a Weight Based Feature Extraction Model on Multifaceted Multimedia Big Data (WbFEM-MMB) is proposed which extracts useful features from videos. The feature extraction strategies utilize features from the discrete cosine methods and the features are extracted using a pre-prepared Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The proposed method is compared with traditional methods and the results show that the proposed method exhibits better performance and accuracy in extracting features from multifaceted multimedia data.",

    "abstract": "Among many applications of machine vision, plant image analysis has recently began to gain more attention due to its potential impact on plant visual phenotyping, particularly in understanding plant growth, assessing the quality/performance of crop plants, and improving crop yield. Despite its importance, the lack of publicly available research databases containing plant imagery has substantially hindered the advancement of plant image analysis. To alleviate this issue, this paper presents a new multi-modality plant imagery database named \u201cMSU-PID,\u201d with two distinct properties. First, MSU-PID is captured using four types of imaging sensors, fluorescence, infrared, RGB color, and depth. Second, the imaging setup and the variety of manual labels allow MSU-PID to be suitable for a diverse set of plant image analysis applications, such as leaf segmentation, leaf counting, leaf alignment, and leaf tracking. We provide detailed information on the plants, imaging sensors, calibration, labeling, and baseline performances of this new database. Title: Tracking Rhythms in Plants, an automated leaf movement analysis program for circadian period estimation Author: KathleenGreenham, Ping Lou1, Sara E Remsen, Hany Farid2 and C Robertson McClung Abstract Background: A well characterized output of the circadian clock in plants is the daily rhythmic movement of leaves. This process has been used extensively in Arabidopsis to estimate circadian period in natural accessions as well as mutants with known defects in circadian clock function. Current methods for estimating circadian period by leaf movement involve manual steps throughout the analysis and are often limited to analyzing one leaf or cotyledon at a time. Results: In this study, we describe the development of TRiP (Tracking Rhythms in Plants), a new method for estimating circadian period using a motion estimation algorithm that can be applied to whole plant images. To validate this new method, we apply TRiP to a International Research Journal of Engineering and Technology (IRJET) e-ISSN: 2395-0056 Volume: 07 Issue: 03 | Mar 2020 www.irjet.net p-ISSN: 2395-0072 \u00a9 2020, IRJET | Impact Factor value: 7.34 | ISO 9001:2008 Certified Journal | Page 5455 Recombinant Inbred Line (RIL) population in Arabidopsis using our high-throughput imaging platform. We begin imaging at the cotyledon stage and image through the emergence of true leaves. Trip successfully tracks the movement of cotyledons and leaves without the need to select individual leaves to be analyzed. 3. EXISTING SYSTEM Traditional reasoning based on logical rules promotes the automation process of reasoning for pest diagnosis and control measures to a certain extent, but it experiences obvious defects, such as insufficient learning ability, low data utilization rate, and inaccurate rate to be improved, which do not meet the requirements of practical application. Considering the increasing data on diseases and insect pests, problems are inevitable, such as missing information and prolonged time. This method is not effective for knowledge map with a large number of relationships and sparse knowledge. The existing system determines crop disease for a specific crop. Results are not accurate in the existing system. 4. PROPOSED SYSTEM Our proposed system concentrates the rapid development of computer vision and image processing technology; it is possible to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the conventional agriculture work such as disease detection and early warning. In this system, we detect various parameters of the leaf. The parameters of the leaves are monitored with the help of digital image processing techniques. The controller is used for alerting or indication purposes.

MODULE DESCRIPTION 6.1 PREPROCESSING Data pre-processing is a crucial step within the data processing process. The phrase \"garbage in, garbage out\" is especially applicable to data processing and machine learning projects. Data-gathering methods are often loosely controlled, leading to out-of-range values impossible data combinations, missing values, etc. Analyzing the data which has not been carefully screened for such problems can produce the misleading results. Thus, the representation and quality of knowledge is first and foremost before running an analysis. Often, data pre-processing is that the most vital phase of a machine learning project, especially in computational biology. The presence of more number of irrelevant and redundant information or noisy and unreliable data makes the knowledge discovery during the training phase harder to process. Data preparation and filtering steps can take considerable amount of time interval. Data pre-processing is a process which includes the following: cleaning, Instance selection, normalization, transformation, feature extraction and selection, etc. the merchandise of knowledge pre-processing is that the final training set. 6.2 IMAGE PRE-PROCESSING Pre-processing is one of the general operation with images at its lowest level of abstraction. The iconic images produced after pre-processing are of very similar kind as the original data which is captured by the sensor. It is generally with an intensity International Research Journal of Engineering and Technology (IRJET) e-ISSN: 2395-0056 Volume: 07 Issue: 03 | Mar 2020 www.irjet.net p-ISSN: 2395-0072 \u00a9 2020, IRJET | Impact Factor value: 7.34 | ISO 9001:2008 Certified Journal | Page 5457 image represented by a matrix of image function values (brightnesses). The mail purpose of pre-processing is improvement of image data that suppresses the unwilling distortions or it enhances some of the image features which are important for further processing. Although geometric transformations of the images (e.g. rotation, scaling, translation) are classified among several pre-processing methods here since similar techniques are used. 6.3 IMAGE ENHANCEMENT In photography, colorimetric, and computing, a grayscale image carries only intensity information. Images of this type is also referred to as black-and-white image or monochrome image and are composed exclusively of reminder gray. These images are varying from black at its weakest intensity and to the white at its strongest. The grayscale images are distinct from black-and-white images, which contains only two colors, black and white (also called bilevel or binary images). These grayscale images have many reminder gray in between. Grayscale images are often the results of measuring the intensity of sunshine at each pixel consistent with a specific weighted combination of frequencies (or wavelengths), and in those cases they are said as monochromatic proper when only one frequency (in practice, a narrow band of frequencies) is captured. The frequencies can within the ory be from anywhere in the spectrum (e.g. infrared, light, ultraviolet, etc.). A colorimetric (or more specifically photometric) grayscale image is a picture that features a defined grayscale colorspace, which maps the stored numeric sample values to the achromatic channel of a typical colorspace, which itself is predicated on measured properties of human vision. If the first color image has no defined colorspace, or if the grayscale image isn't intended to possess an equivalent humanperceived achromatic intensity because the color image, then there is no proper and unique mapping from that color image to a grayscale image. 6.4 EDGE DETECTION Edge detection may be a well-developed field on its own within image processing. The region boundaries and edges are closely related to each other, since there often occurs a pointy adjustment in intensity at the region boundaries. The edges identified by the edge detection techniques are often disconnected. To segment an object from a picture however, one needs closed region boundaries. The desired edges are the boundaries found between objects or spatial-taxons. Spatial-taxons are the ones which provides data such as information granules which consists of a crisp pixel region.That is stationed at abstraction levels within hierarchical nested scene architecture. They are almost like the Gestalt psychological designation of figure-ground, but are extended to incorporate foreground, object groups, objects and salient object parts. Edge detection methods are often applied to the spatial-taxon region, within the same manner they might be applied to a silhouette. This method is especially useful when the disconnected edge is a component of an illusory contour Segmentation methods also can be applied to edges obtained from edge detectors. Edge detection is a well-developed field on its own within image processing. The edges and region boundaries are closely related to each other. Since there is also a sharp adjustment in intensity at the region boundaries. The edges identified by these edge detection techniques are often disconnected. Inorder to segment an object from a particular image closed region boundaries are needed. The desired edges are known to be the boundaries between such objects or spatial-taxons. Spatial-taxons are information granules, consisting of a crisp pixel region, stationed at abstraction levels within hierarchical nested scene architecture. Edge detection methods can also be applied to the spatial-taxon region, in the same manner which they would be applied to a silhouette. This method is considered as a necessary method because th",

    "abstract": "In the field of military research, manufacturing and management of weapons and equipment are very important. Due to the continuous advancement of science and technology, many military equipment databases have a loose structure, which makes them difficult to be utilized efficiently, resulting in low efficiency, chaotic management, and other issues. In order to solve these problems, an entity-relation extraction method based on CRF and syntactic analysis tree is proposed according to the latest text extraction algorithm. Finally, a military knowledge graph construction method is optimized via massive data training, model comparison and improvement. The ternary data extraction method is significantly better than the single algorithm extraction method, and the accuracy of the extracted training model can reach 72%. Compared with the traditional entity-relation extraction method, the accuracy of the entity-relation extraction method based on the fusion of CRF and syntax analysis tree is improved by 12.6% when the confidence model is added, and the comprehensive evaluation accuracy can reach 78.11%. This result has significant practical value for the construction of knowledge graphs in the field of military equipment.",

    "title": "From Vision to Content: Construction of Domain-Specific Multi-Modal Knowledge Graph",
    "abstract": "Knowledge graphs are usually constructed to describe the various concepts that exist in real world as well as the relationships between them. There are many knowledge graphs in specific fields, but they usually pay more attention on text or structured data, ignoring the image vision information, and cannot play an adequate role in the emerging visualization applications. Aiming at this issue, we design a method that integrates image vision information and text information derived from Wikimedia Commons to construct a domain-specific multi-modal knowledge graph, taking the metallic materials domain as an example to illustrate the method. The text description of each image is regarded as its context semantic to acquire the image\u2019s context semantic labels based on the DBpedia resource. Furthermore, we adopt deep neural network model instead of simple visual descriptors to acquire the image\u2019s visual semantic labels using the concepts from WordNet. In order to fuse the visual semantic labels and context semantic labels, a path-based concept extension and fusion strategy is proposed based on the conceptual hierarchies of WordNet and DBpedia to obtain the effective extension concepts as well as the links between them, increasing the scale of the knowledge graph and enhancing the correlation between images. The experimental results show that the maximum extension level has a significant impact on the quality of the generated domain knowledge graph, and the best extension level number is respectively determined for both DBpedia and WordNet. In addition, the results of this paper are compared with IMGpedia to further show the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

    "abstract": "The big data of grid is characterized by a large amount of data and complex structure. There are many kinds of grid equipment in the grid and smart grid, and their relationships are complicated. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze and visualize the grid equipment information and relationships reasonably to improve and develop the grid information system. The power equipment information in the data center is relatively complex and does not reflect the relationships between the equipment well. In order to manage and use grid equipment information better, we propose a grid equipment knowledge graph to solve the problem of \"information island\" of smart grid equipment. A knowledge graph has been constructed according to the grid equipment big data from the grid domain data center, which reflects the multifaceted information of the equipment as well as inter-equipment relationships.",

    "title": "GNER: A Generative Model for Geological Named Entity Recognition Without Labeled Data Using Deep Learning",
    "abstract": "A variety of detailed data about geological topics and geoscience knowledge are buried in the geoscience literature and rarely used. Named entity recognition (NER) provides both opportunities and challenges to leverage this wealth of data in the geoscience literature for data analysis and further information extraction. Existing NER models and techniques are mainly based on rule\u2010based and supervised approaches, and developing such systems requires a costly manual effort. In this paper, we first design a generic stepwise framework for domain\u2010specific NER. Following this framework, domain\u2010specific entities and domain\u2010general words are collected and selected as seed terms. Normalization and grouping processes are then applied to these seed terms for further analysis. A random extraction algorithm based on a unigram language model is used to generate a large\u2010scale training data set consisting of probabilistically labeled pseudosentences. Each generated sentence is then used as input to the self\u2010training and learning algorithm. Experimental results on two constructed data sets demonstrate that the proposed model effectively recognizes and identifies geological named entities.",

Based on the extraction of the time entities, place entities, and fragile ecological remediation technology entities, we analyzed the technologies with the greatest potential from among China's fragile ecological restoration technologies using the category clustering of fragile ecological restoration technologies with LDA and the place distribution and evolution of fragile ecological treatment technologies. This research shows that the proposed Bi\u2010LSTM+CRF combined with the feature\u2010based named entity knowledgebase can be used to perform geographical knowledge discovery from text, and it has has good prospects for applications in intelligence analysis based on text mining.",

    "abstract": "With geological big data becoming a focus of geoscience research, the vast amount of textual geoscience data provides both opportunities and challenges for data analysis and data mining. In fact, it does not seem possible to meet the demands of the big data age through the traditional manual reading for information extraction and gaining knowledge. In this paper, a workflow is proposed to extract prospecting information by text mining based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The aim is to classify the text data and extract the prospecting information automatically. The procedure involves three parts: 1) text data acquisition; 2) text classification based on CNN; and 3) statistics and visualization. First, the large amount of available text data was acquired based on geoscience big data acquisition methodologies. After text preprocessing, the CNN was used to classify the geoscience text data into four categories (geology, geophysics, geochemistry, and remote sensing), with each category consisting of three levels of text scales (word, sentence, and paragraph). Second, the word frequency statistics, co-occurrence matrix statistics, and term frequency\u2013inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) statistics were for words, sentences, and paragraphs, respectively, which aimed to obtain the key nodes and links derived from the content-words. Finally, the deep semantic information of the big data mining of relevant geoscience texts was visualized by word clouds, knowledge graphs (e.g., the chord and bigram graphs), and TF-IDF statistical graphs. The Lala copper deposit in Sichuan province was taken as a test case, for which the prospecting information was extracted successfully by the developed text mining methodologies. This paper provides a strong basis for research into establishing mineral deposits prospecting models based on logical knowledge trees. In addition, it shows the great potential of this method for intelligent information extraction within geoscience big data.",
